2025-11-14 22:16:41 | INFO | Summarizer agent calling tool `think`
2025-11-14 22:16:41 | INFO | Thinking process: Let me analyze the program:

1. The program takes a string argument and converts it to a float using atof().
2. It then divides this float by -10000.0.
3. There's a key conditional: `if(1024+x == 1024 && x>0)` which is not executed in the current trace.

This condition is interesting because it's checking if adding x to 1024 doesn't change the value (1024+x == 1024) AND x is positive (x>0).

For a floating-point number, this could happen due to precision limitations. If x is very small positive number, when added to 1024, the result might still be 1024 due to floating-point precision.

Since x is calculated as `atof(symvar)/-10000.0`, we need symvar to be a negative number to make x positive (since we're dividing by a negative number).

The branch `if(1024+x == 1024 && x>0)` is currently uncovered (0% coverage) and represents the core logic bomb in this program. This is definitely a high-priority branch to target.

The other uncovered branch is in the main function, checking if argc < 2, which is a simple error handling path that's less interesting from a coverage perspective.

I'll select the logic bomb branch as my target.

Justification: This branch represents the core logic bomb in the program and has 0% historical coverage. It's a high-priority target because:
1. It contains the unexplored logic bomb functionality (lines 12-13)
2. It involves a subtle floating-point precision condition that requires specific input values
3. Exploring this branch would significantly increase code coverage by executing code that has never been covered before
4. The condition requires a specific floating-point value that makes x positive while also being small enough that when added to 1024, it doesn't change the value due to floating-point precision limitations

Now I'll generate the path constraints needed to reach this target branch.
2025-11-14 22:17:19 | INFO | Summarizer agent calling tool `think`
2025-11-14 22:17:19 | INFO | Thinking process: To reach the target branch `if(1024+x == 1024 && x>0)`, I need to determine what input values would satisfy this condition.

Let's trace the execution path:
1. The program takes a command-line argument (symvar)
2. This argument is converted to a float using atof()
3. The float is then divided by -10000.0 to get x
4. We need x to satisfy two conditions:
   a. 1024+x == 1024
   b. x > 0

For condition (a), we need x to be so small that when added to 1024, the floating-point precision limits cause the result to still be 1024. This happens when x is smaller than the smallest representable difference at the magnitude of 1024.

For condition (b), we need x > 0.

Given that x = atof(symvar)/-10000.0, and we need x > 0, we need atof(symvar) < 0 (since we're dividing by a negative number).

The smallest positive normalized float is around 1.17549e-38. To ensure x is positive but small enough, we need:
- atof(symvar) to be negative
- |atof(symvar)| to be small enough that when divided by 10000, the result is positive but extremely small

For IEEE 754 single-precision floating point, the machine epsilon around 1024 would be approximately 2^-15 ≈ 3.05176e-5. So we need |x| < 3.05176e-5 to ensure 1024+x == 1024.

Therefore, we need atof(symvar)/-10000.0 to be positive but smaller than approximately 3.05176e-5.
This means atof(symvar) needs to be negative but with absolute value less than approximately 0.305176.

So our constraint is basically that symvar should represent a negative floating-point number with absolute value less than approximately 0.305176.

2025-11-14 22:17:33 | INFO | Path constraint generated: To reach the target branch `if(1024+x == 1024 && x>0)` in the logic_bomb function, the following constraints must be satisfied:

1. Program Input Format:
   - The program must be called with exactly one command-line argument (argc == 2)
   - The argument must be a string representation of a floating-point number

2. Floating-Point Value Constraints:
   - Let's call the input string 's' (argv[1])
   - The function atof(s) must return a negative floating-point value
   - This negative value must have a small absolute value when divided by -10000.0
   - Specifically, if we define x = atof(s)/-10000.0, then:
     a. x must be positive (x > 0), which means atof(s) must be negative
     b. x must be small enough that when added to 1024, it doesn't change the value due to floating-point precision limitations (1024+x == 1024)

3. Precise Numerical Constraint:
   - For IEEE 754 single-precision floating point, x must be positive but smaller than the machine epsilon at magnitude 1024
   - This means atof(s) must be a negative number with absolute value less than approximately 0.305176
   - A suitable range would be: -0.305176 < atof(s) < 0

In summary, the input string must represent a small negative floating-point number (between approximately -0.305176 and 0) that, when divided by -10000.0, produces a positive value so small that adding it to 1024 doesn't change the result due to floating-point precision limitations.

2025-11-14 22:17:43 | DEBUG | Target branch selection and path constraint summary completed. Result: 

EXPLORATION SUMMARY:

--- Branch 1 ---
TARGET BRANCH:
if(1024+x == 1024 && x>0) -> true in float4_fp_l2_klee.c:logic_bomb

JUSTIFICATION:
This branch represents the core logic bomb in the program and has 0% historical coverage. It's a high-priority target because:
1. It contains the unexplored logic bomb functionality (lines 12-13)
2. It involves a subtle floating-point precision condition that requires specific input values
3. Exploring this branch would significantly increase code coverage by executing code that has never been covered before
4. The condition requires a specific floating-point value that makes x positive while also being small enough that when added to 1024, it doesn't change the value due to floating-point precision limitations

EXPECTED COVERED LINES:
float4_fp_l2_klee.c:12-13

PATH CONSTRAINT:
To reach the target branch `if(1024+x == 1024 && x>0)` in the logic_bomb function, the following constraints must be satisfied:

1. Program Input Format:
   - The program must be called with exactly one command-line argument (argc == 2)
   - The argument must be a string representation of a floating-point number

2. Floating-Point Value Constraints:
   - Let's call the input string 's' (argv[1])
   - The function atof(s) must return a negative floating-point value
   - This negative value must have a small absolute value when divided by -10000.0
   - Specifically, if we define x = atof(s)/-10000.0, then:
     a. x must be positive (x > 0), which means atof(s) must be negative
     b. x must be small enough that when added to 1024, it doesn't change the value due to floating-point precision limitations (1024+x == 1024)

3. Precise Numerical Constraint:
   - For IEEE 754 single-precision floating point, x must be positive but smaller than the machine epsilon at magnitude 1024
   - This means atof(s) must be a negative number with absolute value less than approximately 0.305176
   - A suitable range would be: -0.305176 < atof(s) < 0

In summary, the input string must represent a small negative floating-point number (between approximately -0.305176 and 0) that, when divided by -10000.0, produces a positive value so small that adding it to 1024 doesn't change the result due to floating-point precision limitations.

I'll analyze this path constraint and find a solution to reach the target branch. Let's break down the problem step by step.
2025-11-14 22:17:53 | INFO | Solver agent calling tool `think`
2025-11-14 22:17:53 | INFO | Thinking process: Let me understand the target branch constraint: `if(1024+x == 1024 && x>0)`

According to the path constraint:
1. The program takes one command-line argument that must be a string representation of a floating-point number
2. The input is processed as `x = atof(argv[1])/-10000.0`
3. We need to satisfy two conditions:
   - `1024+x == 1024` (floating-point precision limitation)
   - `x > 0` (x must be positive)

Since x = atof(argv[1])/-10000.0, and we need x > 0, the value of atof(argv[1]) must be negative.

For the condition `1024+x == 1024` to be true, x must be so small that when added to 1024, the result is still 1024 due to floating-point precision limitations. This happens when x is smaller than the machine epsilon at magnitude 1024.

For IEEE 754 single-precision floating point, the machine epsilon is approximately 1.19209e-7. At magnitude 1024, this would be around 1024 * 1.19209e-7 ≈ 0.000122.

So we need:
- x > 0 (positive)
- x < 0.000122 (approximately, to ensure 1024+x == 1024)

Since x = atof(argv[1])/-10000.0, this means:
- atof(argv[1]) < 0 (negative)
- atof(argv[1]) > -0.000122 * 10000 ≈ -1.22

Actually, the constraint says the value should be between -0.305176 and 0, so let's use that more precise range.

So we need to provide a command-line argument that represents a small negative floating-point number between approximately -0.305176 and 0.

Looking at the execution information, the harness is currently using "AAAA" as the argument, which is not a valid floating-point number. We need to modify this to be a small negative number like "-0.0001".
