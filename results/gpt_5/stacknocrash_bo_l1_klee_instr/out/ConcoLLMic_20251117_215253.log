2025-11-17 21:53:52 | INFO | Target branch selected: if (strlen(symvar) > 9) -> true in stacknocrash_bo_l1_klee.c:logic_bomb
Justification: This branch has zero historical coverage (lines 13-14: 0/2, 0%). It guards the primary size-based condition on the input string and is guaranteed to lead to a distinct path compared to the current run (which uses a 4-byte argument). Reaching it will exercise code before a potentially dangerous copy into a fixed-size stack buffer, uncovering behavior central to this program’s logic and likely revealing additional issues. It is reachable via the current harness by varying the single command-line argument’s length.

2025-11-17 21:54:24 | INFO | Path constraint generated: Chronological constraints to reach branch `strlen(symvar) > 9` (true) in logic_bomb:

1) Process invocation and argument count
- The program must be executed with exactly one additional command-line argument besides the executable name: argc >= 2.
- The harness invokes: `./temp_executable <ARG>`. Ensure `<ARG>` is provided and parsed as `argv[1]` by the program.

2) Argument form and encoding
- The single argument must be a byte string representing a C-style string: a contiguous sequence of non-null bytes followed by an implicit terminating null byte inserted by the shell/runtime.
- It must not contain embedded NUL (0x00) bytes, because C `strlen` stops at the first NUL and would shorten the measured length.
- Encoding is irrelevant to `strlen`; only byte values matter. Avoid bytes 0x00 prior to the end.

3) Length constraint for target branch
- Let `symvar` be `argv[1]` (the provided argument string). Require: length(symvar) ≥ 10 bytes before the first NUL byte, i.e., `strlen(symvar) > 9`.
- More formally: There exists index i ≥ 10 such that for all j in [0, 9], symvar[j] != 0x00, and symvar[10] may be 0x00 (termination occurs at or after index 10). The first NUL must be at position ≥ 10.

4) Environment and execution mode
- The program must be run normally (no special environment variables are required). Standard permissions must allow execution of `./temp_executable`.
- If using a shell to invoke the executable, ensure quoting/escaping so that the argument is passed as a single contiguous token and not truncated or split.

5) Safety consideration relative to later copy
- The program copies the argument into a fixed 8-byte stack buffer using `strcpy`. To avoid undefined behavior (buffer overflow) during test generation for this specific branch reachability, one may optionally constrain the argument to be at most 7 bytes. However, to specifically reach `strlen(symvar) > 9`, this optional constraint conflicts with the required length ≥ 10. Therefore, DO NOT add any maximum-length constraint; accept that the copy will overflow after the branch is reached. The solver should focus solely on satisfying `strlen(symvar) > 9`.

Summary of core satisfiable constraint:
- Provide a single command-line argument whose first NUL terminator occurs at or after byte offset 10 (0-indexed), i.e., the argument has at least 10 non-NUL bytes when received by the program.

if (strlen(symvar) > 9) -> true in stacknocrash_bo_l1_klee.c:logic_bomb

JUSTIFICATION:
This branch has zero historical coverage (lines 13-14: 0/2, 0%). It guards the primary size-based condition on the input string and is guaranteed to lead to a distinct path compared to the current run (which uses a 4-byte argument). Reaching it will exercise code before a potentially dangerous copy into a fixed-size stack buffer, uncovering behavior central to this program’s logic and likely revealing additional issues. It is reachable via the current harness by varying the single command-line argument’s length.

EXPECTED COVERED LINES:
stacknocrash_bo_l1_klee.c:13-14

PATH CONSTRAINT:
Chronological constraints to reach branch `strlen(symvar) > 9` (true) in logic_bomb:

1) Process invocation and argument count
- The program must be executed with exactly one additional command-line argument besides the executable name: argc >= 2.
- The harness invokes: `./temp_executable <ARG>`. Ensure `<ARG>` is provided and parsed as `argv[1]` by the program.

2) Argument form and encoding
- The single argument must be a byte string representing a C-style string: a contiguous sequence of non-null bytes followed by an implicit terminating null byte inserted by the shell/runtime.
- It must not contain embedded NUL (0x00) bytes, because C `strlen` stops at the first NUL and would shorten the measured length.
- Encoding is irrelevant to `strlen`; only byte values matter. Avoid bytes 0x00 prior to the end.

3) Length constraint for target branch
- Let `symvar` be `argv[1]` (the provided argument string). Require: length(symvar) ≥ 10 bytes before the first NUL byte, i.e., `strlen(symvar) > 9`.
- More formally: There exists index i ≥ 10 such that for all j in [0, 9], symvar[j] != 0x00, and symvar[10] may be 0x00 (termination occurs at or after index 10). The first NUL must be at position ≥ 10.

4) Environment and execution mode
- The program must be run normally (no special environment variables are required). Standard permissions must allow execution of `./temp_executable`.
- If using a shell to invoke the executable, ensure quoting/escaping so that the argument is passed as a single contiguous token and not truncated or split.

5) Safety consideration relative to later copy
- The program copies the argument into a fixed 8-byte stack buffer using `strcpy`. To avoid undefined behavior (buffer overflow) during test generation for this specific branch reachability, one may optionally constrain the argument to be at most 7 bytes. However, to specifically reach `strlen(symvar) > 9`, this optional constraint conflicts with the required length ≥ 10. Therefore, DO NOT add any maximum-length constraint; accept that the copy will overflow after the branch is reached. The solver should focus solely on satisfying `strlen(symvar) > 9`.

Summary of core satisfiable constraint:
- Provide a single command-line argument whose first NUL terminator occurs at or after byte offset 10 (0-indexed), i.e., the argument has at least 10 non-NUL bytes when received by the program.

Justification: This branch (lines 20-21) has 0% historical coverage and represents the core security-relevant behavior: the program prints "Logic bomb triggered" and returns 1 only if the internal control value becomes 1, which is reachable via the unchecked copy into an 8-byte stack buffer. Exercising this path covers the vulnerable logic and a previously unseen outcome, substantially improving coverage compared to re-exercising already-covered "Path without the bomb" paths.

1) Program invocation (arguments must be present and parsed as intended)
- The program must be invoked with at least one command-line argument beyond the executable name, so that the first user-controlled argument is available as argv[1].
- Ensure argv[1] is passed as a single token (no spaces, tabs, or shell metacharacters that would split it). Treat argv[1] as a contiguous byte string in the OS process table.

2) Length guard must be satisfied to avoid early return
- The byte length of argv[1] (number of non-NUL bytes before the implicit terminating NUL) must be <= 9 to pass the check `strlen(argv[1]) > 9` -> false.
- To enable a controlled overflow past an 8-byte buffer, the length must be exactly 9 bytes (non-NUL), so that the copy writes 9 data bytes plus the terminating NUL, totaling 10 bytes.

3) Copy semantics and overflow into adjacent control field
- The program copies argv[1] into an 8-byte stack buffer using a NUL-terminated copy. With a 9-byte argument, the write will overflow the buffer by 2 bytes (1 data byte and then the terminating NUL). To make the subsequent control check succeed, this overflow must set the 4-byte integer control field located immediately adjacent to the buffer (on the stack) to the value 1.
- Environmental/architecture assumptions required for determinism:
  a) The platform uses 32-bit `int` (common on x86/x86_64 ABIs).
  b) The platform is little-endian (least significant byte stored at the lowest address).
  c) The 4-byte control integer is immediately contiguous after the 8-byte buffer in the overflow direction (typical local layout for this code under common compiler settings; no stack protectors or reordering that would insert padding/guards between them).
- Under these assumptions, enforce the following byte-level constraint on argv[1]:
  • Bytes 0..7: any non-NUL values (content unrestricted).
  • Byte 8 (the 9th byte): 0x01. This byte becomes the least significant byte of the adjacent 4-byte integer when overflow occurs, setting it from 0 to 1.
  • The terminating NUL written by the copy immediately after byte 8 provides 0x00 for the next byte of that integer. The remaining two most significant bytes of that integer must remain 0x00 (unchanged from initialization) to ensure the final integer value is exactly 1.

4) Encoding/content constraints
- argv[1] must contain no embedded NUL (0x00) prior to the 9th byte; otherwise, the copy would stop earlier and not overflow.
- Avoid spaces or shell-special characters so argv[1] is not split or altered by the shell; use bytes in the visible ASCII range or any non-whitespace bytes. The 9th byte must be exactly 0x01 (control-A) at the byte level; higher-level encodings must preserve this raw byte value.

Effect of the constraints
- Satisfying the above causes the 8-byte buffer copy to overflow into the adjacent 4-byte control field and set its value to 1. This makes the subsequent condition `flag == 1` evaluate to true, reaching the target branch and executing the lines that print "Logic bomb triggered" and return 1.

EXPLORATION SUMMARY:

--- Branch 1 ---
TARGET BRANCH:
if (flag == 1) -> true in stacknocrash_bo_l1_klee.c:logic_bomb

JUSTIFICATION:
This branch (lines 20-21) has 0% historical coverage and represents the core security-relevant behavior: the program prints "Logic bomb triggered" and returns 1 only if the internal control value becomes 1, which is reachable via the unchecked copy into an 8-byte stack buffer. Exercising this path covers the vulnerable logic and a previously unseen outcome, substantially improving coverage compared to re-exercising already-covered "Path without the bomb" paths.

EXPECTED COVERED LINES:
stacknocrash_bo_l1_klee.c:20-21

PATH CONSTRAINT:
Chronological, self-contained constraints to reach: if (flag == 1) -> true in logic_bomb

1) Program invocation (arguments must be present and parsed as intended)
- The program must be invoked with at least one command-line argument beyond the executable name, so that the first user-controlled argument is available as argv[1].
- Ensure argv[1] is passed as a single token (no spaces, tabs, or shell metacharacters that would split it). Treat argv[1] as a contiguous byte string in the OS process table.

2) Length guard must be satisfied to avoid early return
- The byte length of argv[1] (number of non-NUL bytes before the implicit terminating NUL) must be <= 9 to pass the check `strlen(argv[1]) > 9` -> false.
- To enable a controlled overflow past an 8-byte buffer, the length must be exactly 9 bytes (non-NUL), so that the copy writes 9 data bytes plus the terminating NUL, totaling 10 bytes.

3) Copy semantics and overflow into adjacent control field
- The program copies argv[1] into an 8-byte stack buffer using a NUL-terminated copy. With a 9-byte argument, the write will overflow the buffer by 2 bytes (1 data byte and then the terminating NUL). To make the subsequent control check succeed, this overflow must set the 4-byte integer control field located immediately adjacent to the buffer (on the stack) to the value 1.
- Environmental/architecture assumptions required for determinism:
  a) The platform uses 32-bit `int` (common on x86/x86_64 ABIs).
  b) The platform is little-endian (least significant byte stored at the lowest address).
  c) The 4-byte control integer is immediately contiguous after the 8-byte buffer in the overflow direction (typical local layout for this code under common compiler settings; no stack protectors or reordering that would insert padding/guards between them).
- Under these assumptions, enforce the following byte-level constraint on argv[1]:
  • Bytes 0..7: any non-NUL values (content unrestricted).
  • Byte 8 (the 9th byte): 0x01. This byte becomes the least significant byte of the adjacent 4-byte integer when overflow occurs, setting it from 0 to 1.
  • The terminating NUL written by the copy immediately after byte 8 provides 0x00 for the next byte of that integer. The remaining two most significant bytes of that integer must remain 0x00 (unchanged from initialization) to ensure the final integer value is exactly 1.

4) Encoding/content constraints
- argv[1] must contain no embedded NUL (0x00) prior to the 9th byte; otherwise, the copy would stop earlier and not overflow.
- Avoid spaces or shell-special characters so argv[1] is not split or altered by the shell; use bytes in the visible ASCII range or any non-whitespace bytes. The 9th byte must be exactly 0x01 (control-A) at the byte level; higher-level encodings must preserve this raw byte value.

Effect of the constraints
- Satisfying the above causes the 8-byte buffer copy to overflow into the adjacent 4-byte control field and set its value to 1. This makes the subsequent condition `flag == 1` evaluate to true, reaching the target branch and executing the lines that print "Logic bomb triggered" and return 1.
