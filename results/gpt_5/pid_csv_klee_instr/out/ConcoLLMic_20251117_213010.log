Justification: This is the core branching condition of the program and currently has 0% historical coverage for its true arm (lines 15-16). Reaching this branch will explore the intended “bomb” path, which has never been executed. Other uncovered branches (e.g., argc < 2) are unreachable with the fixed harness that always passes one argument. Therefore, this branch provides the highest feasible coverage gain given the harness constraints.

2025-11-17 21:31:49 | INFO | Path constraint generated: Chronological, input-and-environment level constraints to reach the branch `pid % 78 == (s[0] - 48)` as TRUE in pid_csv_klee.c:logic_bomb:

1) Process launch and argument count:
- The program must be invoked with at least one command-line argument.
- Given the harness, the program is executed as a shell command `./temp_executable AAAA`. This satisfies the minimum argument requirement and provides a single argument string "AAAA" to the binary.

2) Argument format and length:
- The program reads the first argument (argv[1]) as a string s.
- s must have length ≥ 1 because s[0] is accessed. The harness supplies a 4-character ASCII string, which meets this requirement.
- The character encoding must be standard ASCII/UTF-8 such that the first byte maps directly to the ASCII value used by the code. The code subtracts 48 (ASCII code for '0'), so s[0] should be a single-byte ASCII digit character '0'..'9' to yield an integer in 0..9.

3) Environment constraint on process ID (PID):
- Let current process ID be pid = getpid(). This is determined by the operating system at runtime and cannot be directly set via normal input. The branch requires: pid % 78 == (ord(s[0]) - 48).
- Therefore, the first character of s must be chosen so that its digit value equals pid modulo 78. Formally: s[0] ∈ {'0','1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9'} and (ord(s[0]) - 48) == (getpid() mod 78).

4) Combined path condition:
- All preceding constraints must hold simultaneously such that the evaluation of `pid % 78 == symvar` is true, where symvar = s[0] - 48.
- No other inputs or environment variables are checked.

5) Negative constraints (to avoid alternative path):
- Ensure s[0] is a digit; if s[0] is a non-digit, (s[0] - 48) yields a value outside 0..9, which may still be compared but is unlikely to equal pid%78 except coincidentally. To deterministically reach the true branch, constrain s[0] to a digit and to the specific value equal to pid%78.

SMT-style formulation (supplementary):
- Constants: 78 ∈ ℤ.
- Variables: pid ∈ ℤ, c ∈ [0,255] (first byte of s), len ∈ ℕ.
- Constraints:
  (i) len ≥ 1
  (ii) c ∈ {48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57}
  (iii) pid = getpid()
  (iv) (pid mod 78) = (c - 48)
- The remaining bytes of s are unconstrained.

EXPLORATION SUMMARY:

--- Branch 1 ---
TARGET BRANCH:
if (pid % 78 == (s[0] - 48)) -> true in pid_csv_klee.c:logic_bomb

JUSTIFICATION:
This is the core branching condition of the program and currently has 0% historical coverage for its true arm (lines 15-16). Reaching this branch will explore the intended “bomb” path, which has never been executed. Other uncovered branches (e.g., argc < 2) are unreachable with the fixed harness that always passes one argument. Therefore, this branch provides the highest feasible coverage gain given the harness constraints.

EXPECTED COVERED LINES:
pid_csv_klee.c:15-16

PATH CONSTRAINT:
Chronological, input-and-environment level constraints to reach the branch `pid % 78 == (s[0] - 48)` as TRUE in pid_csv_klee.c:logic_bomb:

1) Process launch and argument count:
- The program must be invoked with at least one command-line argument.
- Given the harness, the program is executed as a shell command `./temp_executable AAAA`. This satisfies the minimum argument requirement and provides a single argument string "AAAA" to the binary.

2) Argument format and length:
- The program reads the first argument (argv[1]) as a string s.
- s must have length ≥ 1 because s[0] is accessed. The harness supplies a 4-character ASCII string, which meets this requirement.
- The character encoding must be standard ASCII/UTF-8 such that the first byte maps directly to the ASCII value used by the code. The code subtracts 48 (ASCII code for '0'), so s[0] should be a single-byte ASCII digit character '0'..'9' to yield an integer in 0..9.

3) Environment constraint on process ID (PID):
- Let current process ID be pid = getpid(). This is determined by the operating system at runtime and cannot be directly set via normal input. The branch requires: pid % 78 == (ord(s[0]) - 48).
- Therefore, the first character of s must be chosen so that its digit value equals pid modulo 78. Formally: s[0] ∈ {'0','1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9'} and (ord(s[0]) - 48) == (getpid() mod 78).

4) Combined path condition:
- All preceding constraints must hold simultaneously such that the evaluation of `pid % 78 == symvar` is true, where symvar = s[0] - 48.
- No other inputs or environment variables are checked.

5) Negative constraints (to avoid alternative path):
- Ensure s[0] is a digit; if s[0] is a non-digit, (s[0] - 48) yields a value outside 0..9, which may still be compared but is unlikely to equal pid%78 except coincidentally. To deterministically reach the true branch, constrain s[0] to a digit and to the specific value equal to pid%78.

SMT-style formulation (supplementary):
- Constants: 78 ∈ ℤ.
- Variables: pid ∈ ℤ, c ∈ [0,255] (first byte of s), len ∈ ℕ.
- Constraints:
  (i) len ≥ 1
  (ii) c ∈ {48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57}
  (iii) pid = getpid()
  (iv) (pid mod 78) = (c - 48)
- The remaining bytes of s are unconstrained.

Justification: The only branch with zero historical coverage is `if (argc < 2)` in main, but the fixed harness always supplies one argument and cannot be modified, making that branch unreachable under the current setup. The `pid % 78 == symvar` branch in logic_bomb was not taken in the current execution and is the only reachable alternative path with the existing harness. Selecting it enables exploration of the “bomb” path guarded by the PID-dependent condition, diversifying execution and exercising environment-sensitive behavior, despite its body having historical coverage. This is the most feasible target to reach given the fixed input and harness constraints.

2025-11-17 21:35:00 | INFO | Path constraint generated: Chronological, external-input constraints to reach: if (pid % 78 == (argv[1][0] - 48)) evaluates to true in logic_bomb.

1. Process launch and argument count:
- The program must be executed with exactly one required user argument present, as the harness already does: argv[1] exists and is a non-empty string. No changes to the number of arguments are needed.

2. Argument content (first character constraint):
- Let s be the string passed as the single command-line argument.
- Its first byte (s[0]) must be an ASCII digit character '0' through '9'. This ensures that (s[0] - 48) is a valid integer between 0 and 9.
- Define symvar := numeric_value_of_first_digit(s) ∈ {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.

3. Process ID relation constraint:
- Let pid be the decimal process identifier of the running process at the time logic_bomb() is called.
- The following arithmetic relation must hold: pid mod 78 = symvar.

4. Remaining argument bytes:
- No constraints on subsequent bytes; they may be arbitrary printable characters. The string must remain valid under the platform’s default encoding (UTF-8 is acceptable) and be NUL-terminated as required by C strings.

5. Environment/system constraints enabling PID control (if applicable):
- To satisfy pid mod 78 = symvar, the testing environment must permit controlling or selecting the process ID modulo 78 (e.g., by scheduling or isolating execution so the spawned process PID achieves the desired residue class). There are no additional filesystem or I/O requirements.

These constraints are sufficient for any solver/test-generation system that can choose the first argument’s leading digit and influence (directly or indirectly) the process PID residue to reach the true branch.

EXPLORATION SUMMARY:

--- Branch 1 ---
TARGET BRANCH:
if (pid % 78 == (argv[1][0] - 48)) -> true in pid_csv_klee.c:logic_bomb

JUSTIFICATION:
The only branch with zero historical coverage is `if (argc < 2)` in main, but the fixed harness always supplies one argument and cannot be modified, making that branch unreachable under the current setup. The `pid % 78 == symvar` branch in logic_bomb was not taken in the current execution and is the only reachable alternative path with the existing harness. Selecting it enables exploration of the “bomb” path guarded by the PID-dependent condition, diversifying execution and exercising environment-sensitive behavior, despite its body having historical coverage. This is the most feasible target to reach given the fixed input and harness constraints.

EXPECTED COVERED LINES:
pid_csv_klee.c:15-16

PATH CONSTRAINT:
Chronological, external-input constraints to reach: if (pid % 78 == (argv[1][0] - 48)) evaluates to true in logic_bomb.

1. Process launch and argument count:
- The program must be executed with exactly one required user argument present, as the harness already does: argv[1] exists and is a non-empty string. No changes to the number of arguments are needed.

2. Argument content (first character constraint):
- Let s be the string passed as the single command-line argument.
- Its first byte (s[0]) must be an ASCII digit character '0' through '9'. This ensures that (s[0] - 48) is a valid integer between 0 and 9.
- Define symvar := numeric_value_of_first_digit(s) ∈ {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.

3. Process ID relation constraint:
- Let pid be the decimal process identifier of the running process at the time logic_bomb() is called.
- The following arithmetic relation must hold: pid mod 78 = symvar.

4. Remaining argument bytes:
- No constraints on subsequent bytes; they may be arbitrary printable characters. The string must remain valid under the platform’s default encoding (UTF-8 is acceptable) and be NUL-terminated as required by C strings.

5. Environment/system constraints enabling PID control (if applicable):
- To satisfy pid mod 78 = symvar, the testing environment must permit controlling or selecting the process ID modulo 78 (e.g., by scheduling or isolating execution so the spawned process PID achieves the desired residue class). There are no additional filesystem or I/O requirements.

These constraints are sufficient for any solver/test-generation system that can choose the first argument’s leading digit and influence (directly or indirectly) the process PID residue to reach the true branch.
