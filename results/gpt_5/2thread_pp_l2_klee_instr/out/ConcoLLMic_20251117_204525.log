Justification: This branch has zero historical coverage (line cov: 0/2 (0%)) and represents the core “bomb-triggering” behavior of the program. Exercising it will drive execution down a completely new path compared to the current run (which prints the non-bomb message). Although threading introduces nondeterminism, we can specify input and environment-level constraints (including scheduling) to make the path feasible. No other uncovered branches in this file offer comparable behavioral novelty or coverage gain under the current harness.

2025-11-17 20:47:50 | INFO | Path constraint generated: Chronological, self-contained constraints to reach the branch i == -1900 in logic_bomb:

1) Program invocation (command-line arguments):
- The harness executes the binary with exactly one extra argument beyond argv[0]. This must be a string of length ≥ 1 such that its first character determines the integer derived below. Environment must allow process creation and argument passing.

2) Input-to-integer mapping requirement:
- The program reads the first character of the provided argument string (s[0]) and computes symvar = (ASCII_code_of_first_char) − 48.
- Therefore, let c be the first character of the argument string. Define symvar = ord(c) − 48. ord(c) must be an integer in the ASCII range [0,255], but meaningful numeric mapping occurs for digit characters '0'..'9' (ASCII 48..57), which yield symvar in [0..9]. Non-digit characters are allowed but will produce symvar outside [0..9].

3) Relationship needed for the target branch in presence of concurrent modification:
- ThreadProp receives in0 = symvar − 909. Two threads concurrently modify the same integer in0 by repeatedly incrementing (Inc) and decrementing (Dec) with the following rules:
  a) Inc: While current_value > −1000 and iteration_count < 1000, perform current_value := current_value + 1 per iteration.
  b) Dec: While current_value < +1000 and iteration_count < 1000, perform current_value := current_value − 1 per iteration.
- Both threads run up to 1000 iterations each, subject to the current_value crossing the respective stop thresholds. ThreadProp returns the final shared integer value after both threads join.
- To make the branch i == −1900 true, the returned value must be exactly −1900.

4) Scheduling/environment constraints to force i == −1900:
- Because both threads operate on the same integer and stop based on its current value, the only way to reach −1900 is:
  a) The decrement thread (Dec) must complete 1000 successful decrements without being prevented by its stop condition (current_value < +1000) and without concurrent increments offsetting its progress.
  b) The increment thread (Inc) must perform zero successful increments; this requires that at the time Inc evaluates its while condition for the first time, the shared integer be ≤ −1000 so that Inc’s guard (current_value > −1000) is false.
- Let initial shared value be in0 = symvar − 909. For Inc to not execute at all, require in0 ≤ −1000.
- For Dec to execute exactly 1000 decrements, require that it starts with in0 < +1000 (always true if in0 ≤ −1000) and that scheduling permits Dec to run and complete all 1000 decrements before Inc gets a chance to increment (which will not happen if Inc’s guard is already false). Under these conditions, Dec will move the value from in0 to in0 − 1000.
- With in0 ≤ −1000 ensuring Inc is inactive, the final value i after Dec’s 1000 decrements is i = in0 − 1000.
- To satisfy i == −1900, require in0 − 1000 = −1900 ⇒ in0 = −900.
- Combine with Inc-inactivity constraint in0 ≤ −1000: This is incompatible with in0 = −900; hence, for i == −1900 to hold, we must instead permit Inc’s guard initially true but ensure Inc performs exactly zero net increments across the run. However, Inc’s guard current_value > −1000 is true for in0 = −900, so Inc could increment. To prevent any increments, impose a scheduling constraint: Dec must run its first iteration before Inc checks the condition, making the value −901, which still keeps Inc’s guard true; therefore, additional scheduling control is needed.

5) Correct feasibility conditions without relying on disabling Inc:
- Observe both threads have independent iteration caps (≤1000). Regardless of scheduling, the net effect after both threads complete is:
  final_value = in0 + (#Inc_successes) − (#Dec_successes), with 0 ≤ each ≤ 1000 and subject to stop guards.
- Guards limit maximum #Inc_successes: Inc stops if value ≤ −1000; starting from in0, the maximum successful increments before hitting the guard is max_inc = max(0, in0 − (−1000)) = max(0, in0 + 1000). Similarly, Dec stops if value ≥ +1000; the maximum successful decrements before hitting the guard is max_dec = max(0, 1000 − in0). Each is also capped by 1000.
- For any in0 in [−1000, +1000], both caps are 1000; in this range, Inc can do up to in0 + 1000 increments (but capped at 1000), and Dec can do up to 1000 − in0 decrements (capped at 1000). Consequently:
  If −1000 ≤ in0 ≤ +1000, the absolute maximum total change is bounded and final_value must lie within [−2000, +2000]. To achieve exactly −1900, we require (#Inc_successes) − (#Dec_successes) = −1900 − in0.

6) Algebraic requirement on the input character:
- Since in0 = symvar − 909 and symvar = ord(c) − 48, we need final_value = −1900.
- If both threads reach their iteration caps (1000 each), then final_value = in0 + 1000 − 1000 = in0, which cannot reach −1900 unless in0 = −1900 (impossible because in0 = symvar − 909 with symvar ∈ [−48..207]).
- To make final_value = −1900 feasible, the run must end with (#Inc_successes) − (#Dec_successes) = −1900 − in0. Since both success counts are integers between 0 and 1000 and subject to guards, choose c such that in0 is near 0 and scheduling biases toward decrements. The necessary numeric relation is:
  There exist integers x, y with 0 ≤ x ≤ 1000 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 1000 such that:
    in0 + x − y = −1900,
  with guard feasibility maintained throughout (value always strictly > −1000 before each Inc step and strictly < +1000 before each Dec step).
- Rearranged: y − x = 1900 + in0.
- Because y − x ∈ [−1000, +1000], for feasibility we require 1900 + in0 ∈ [−1000, +1000] ⇒ in0 ∈ [−2900, −900]. Combined with in0 = symvar − 909 implies symvar ∈ [−1991, −− -?]. However symvar is derived from a byte; therefore, the only feasible portion is in0 ∈ [−900, −?]. The tightest feasible window that allows y − x ≤ 1000 is in0 ∈ [−900, +100]. To hit y − x = 1900 + in0 ≤ 1000, require in0 ≤ −900.
- Thus, impose the input constraint:
  symvar − 909 ≤ −900 ⇒ symvar ≤ 9 ⇒ ord(c) − 48 ≤ 9 ⇒ ord(c) ≤ 57.
- Additionally, to keep symvar realistic and prevent undefined behavior, require ord(c) ≥ 48 (digits). Therefore, c must be a digit '0'..'9'.

7) Scheduling constraint to realize y − x = 1900 + in0 with in0 ≤ −900:
- For in0 = −900 (i.e., c producing symvar = 9), target y − x = 1000. Enforce environment scheduling such that:
  Dec completes 1000 successful iterations before Inc completes any iterations that survive the guard; Inc may be created but must either be preempted or immediately have its guard fail after Dec moves the value sufficiently negative. This produces final_value = −1900.
- Practically, require runtime environment that biases scheduling strongly in favor of the Dec thread (e.g., OS scheduler giving Dec a full time slice first, or processor affinity/priorities so Dec runs to cap before Inc executes). No modifications to program code; only environmental scheduling bias.

Summary of actionable constraints:
A) Command-line argument must be a string whose first character is a digit '9' (to maximize feasibility within the harness that passes a 4-char string; only the first char matters). Formally: ord(s[0]) ∈ [48..57]. Prefer ord(s[0]) = 57 ('9') giving symvar = 9 and in0 = −900.
B) OS/thread scheduling must allow the decrement thread to perform exactly 1000 decrements before any net increments, ensuring final_value = in0 − 1000 = −1900.
C) No additional environment restrictions; default limits on threads and time must permit up to 1000 iterations per thread without preemption that would allow Inc to counteract Dec.

EXPLORATION SUMMARY:

--- Branch 1 ---
TARGET BRANCH:
if (i == -1900) -> true in 2thread_pp_l2_klee.c:logic_bomb

JUSTIFICATION:
This branch has zero historical coverage (line cov: 0/2 (0%)) and represents the core “bomb-triggering” behavior of the program. Exercising it will drive execution down a completely new path compared to the current run (which prints the non-bomb message). Although threading introduces nondeterminism, we can specify input and environment-level constraints (including scheduling) to make the path feasible. No other uncovered branches in this file offer comparable behavioral novelty or coverage gain under the current harness.

EXPECTED COVERED LINES:
2thread_pp_l2_klee.c:39-40

PATH CONSTRAINT:
Chronological, self-contained constraints to reach the branch i == -1900 in logic_bomb:

1) Program invocation (command-line arguments):
- The harness executes the binary with exactly one extra argument beyond argv[0]. This must be a string of length ≥ 1 such that its first character determines the integer derived below. Environment must allow process creation and argument passing.

2) Input-to-integer mapping requirement:
- The program reads the first character of the provided argument string (s[0]) and computes symvar = (ASCII_code_of_first_char) − 48.
- Therefore, let c be the first character of the argument string. Define symvar = ord(c) − 48. ord(c) must be an integer in the ASCII range [0,255], but meaningful numeric mapping occurs for digit characters '0'..'9' (ASCII 48..57), which yield symvar in [0..9]. Non-digit characters are allowed but will produce symvar outside [0..9].

3) Relationship needed for the target branch in presence of concurrent modification:
- ThreadProp receives in0 = symvar − 909. Two threads concurrently modify the same integer in0 by repeatedly incrementing (Inc) and decrementing (Dec) with the following rules:
  a) Inc: While current_value > −1000 and iteration_count < 1000, perform current_value := current_value + 1 per iteration.
  b) Dec: While current_value < +1000 and iteration_count < 1000, perform current_value := current_value − 1 per iteration.
- Both threads run up to 1000 iterations each, subject to the current_value crossing the respective stop thresholds. ThreadProp returns the final shared integer value after both threads join.
- To make the branch i == −1900 true, the returned value must be exactly −1900.

4) Scheduling/environment constraints to force i == −1900:
- Because both threads operate on the same integer and stop based on its current value, the only way to reach −1900 is:
  a) The decrement thread (Dec) must complete 1000 successful decrements without being prevented by its stop condition (current_value < +1000) and without concurrent increments offsetting its progress.
  b) The increment thread (Inc) must perform zero successful increments; this requires that at the time Inc evaluates its while condition for the first time, the shared integer be ≤ −1000 so that Inc’s guard (current_value > −1000) is false.
- Let initial shared value be in0 = symvar − 909. For Inc to not execute at all, require in0 ≤ −1000.
- For Dec to execute exactly 1000 decrements, require that it starts with in0 < +1000 (always true if in0 ≤ −1000) and that scheduling permits Dec to run and complete all 1000 decrements before Inc gets a chance to increment (which will not happen if Inc’s guard is already false). Under these conditions, Dec will move the value from in0 to in0 − 1000.
- With in0 ≤ −1000 ensuring Inc is inactive, the final value i after Dec’s 1000 decrements is i = in0 − 1000.
- To satisfy i == −1900, require in0 − 1000 = −1900 ⇒ in0 = −900.
- Combine with Inc-inactivity constraint in0 ≤ −1000: This is incompatible with in0 = −900; hence, for i == −1900 to hold, we must instead permit Inc’s guard initially true but ensure Inc performs exactly zero net increments across the run. However, Inc’s guard current_value > −1000 is true for in0 = −900, so Inc could increment. To prevent any increments, impose a scheduling constraint: Dec must run its first iteration before Inc checks the condition, making the value −901, which still keeps Inc’s guard true; therefore, additional scheduling control is needed.

5) Correct feasibility conditions without relying on disabling Inc:
- Observe both threads have independent iteration caps (≤1000). Regardless of scheduling, the net effect after both threads complete is:
  final_value = in0 + (#Inc_successes) − (#Dec_successes), with 0 ≤ each ≤ 1000 and subject to stop guards.
- Guards limit maximum #Inc_successes: Inc stops if value ≤ −1000; starting from in0, the maximum successful increments before hitting the guard is max_inc = max(0, in0 − (−1000)) = max(0, in0 + 1000). Similarly, Dec stops if value ≥ +1000; the maximum successful decrements before hitting the guard is max_dec = max(0, 1000 − in0). Each is also capped by 1000.
- For any in0 in [−1000, +1000], both caps are 1000; in this range, Inc can do up to in0 + 1000 increments (but capped at 1000), and Dec can do up to 1000 − in0 decrements (capped at 1000). Consequently:
  If −1000 ≤ in0 ≤ +1000, the absolute maximum total change is bounded and final_value must lie within [−2000, +2000]. To achieve exactly −1900, we require (#Inc_successes) − (#Dec_successes) = −1900 − in0.

6) Algebraic requirement on the input character:
- Since in0 = symvar − 909 and symvar = ord(c) − 48, we need final_value = −1900.
- If both threads reach their iteration caps (1000 each), then final_value = in0 + 1000 − 1000 = in0, which cannot reach −1900 unless in0 = −1900 (impossible because in0 = symvar − 909 with symvar ∈ [−48..207]).
- To make final_value = −1900 feasible, the run must end with (#Inc_successes) − (#Dec_successes) = −1900 − in0. Since both success counts are integers between 0 and 1000 and subject to guards, choose c such that in0 is near 0 and scheduling biases toward decrements. The necessary numeric relation is:
  There exist integers x, y with 0 ≤ x ≤ 1000 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 1000 such that:
    in0 + x − y = −1900,
  with guard feasibility maintained throughout (value always strictly > −1000 before each Inc step and strictly < +1000 before each Dec step).
- Rearranged: y − x = 1900 + in0.
- Because y − x ∈ [−1000, +1000], for feasibility we require 1900 + in0 ∈ [−1000, +1000] ⇒ in0 ∈ [−2900, −900]. Combined with in0 = symvar − 909 implies symvar ∈ [−1991, −− -?]. However symvar is derived from a byte; therefore, the only feasible portion is in0 ∈ [−900, −?]. The tightest feasible window that allows y − x ≤ 1000 is in0 ∈ [−900, +100]. To hit y − x = 1900 + in0 ≤ 1000, require in0 ≤ −900.
- Thus, impose the input constraint:
  symvar − 909 ≤ −900 ⇒ symvar ≤ 9 ⇒ ord(c) − 48 ≤ 9 ⇒ ord(c) ≤ 57.
- Additionally, to keep symvar realistic and prevent undefined behavior, require ord(c) ≥ 48 (digits). Therefore, c must be a digit '0'..'9'.

7) Scheduling constraint to realize y − x = 1900 + in0 with in0 ≤ −900:
- For in0 = −900 (i.e., c producing symvar = 9), target y − x = 1000. Enforce environment scheduling such that:
  Dec completes 1000 successful iterations before Inc completes any iterations that survive the guard; Inc may be created but must either be preempted or immediately have its guard fail after Dec moves the value sufficiently negative. This produces final_value = −1900.
- Practically, require runtime environment that biases scheduling strongly in favor of the Dec thread (e.g., OS scheduler giving Dec a full time slice first, or processor affinity/priorities so Dec runs to cap before Inc executes). No modifications to program code; only environmental scheduling bias.

Summary of actionable constraints:
A) Command-line argument must be a string whose first character is a digit '9' (to maximize feasibility within the harness that passes a 4-char string; only the first char matters). Formally: ord(s[0]) ∈ [48..57]. Prefer ord(s[0]) = 57 ('9') giving symvar = 9 and in0 = −900.
B) OS/thread scheduling must allow the decrement thread to perform exactly 1000 decrements before any net increments, ensuring final_value = in0 − 1000 = −1900.
C) No additional environment restrictions; default limits on threads and time must permit up to 1000 iterations per thread without preemption that would allow Inc to counteract Dec.
