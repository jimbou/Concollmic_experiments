justification: |-
  This branch is the most interesting one with 0% historical coverage. It represents the "Logic bomb triggered" path which is the main security vulnerability in this program. 

  The `flag` variable is initialized to 0 and is never explicitly set to 1 in the code. However, there's a buffer overflow vulnerability where `strcpy(buf, symvar)` is used without bounds checking. Since `flag` is declared before `buf` in the function, a carefully crafted input string of the right length could overflow `buf` and modify the value of `flag` on the stack to 1, triggering this branch.

  This branch requires understanding memory layout and stack behavior, making it more complex than the other uncovered branches. Exploring this branch would reveal a security vulnerability and significantly improve code coverage by executing previously uncovered code paths.
target_path_constraint: |-
  To reach the target branch `if(flag == 1) -> true` in the logic_bomb function, the following constraints must be satisfied:

  1. Command-line argument constraints:
     - The program must be executed with at least one command-line argument (argc >= 2)
     - This ensures we pass the check `if (argc < 2)` in main()

  2. Input string length constraint:
     - The length of the input string (argv[1]) must be <= 9 characters
     - This ensures we pass the check `if(strlen(symvar) > 9)` in logic_bomb()

  3. Buffer overflow constraint:
     - The input string must be carefully crafted to overflow the buffer `buf[8]` and modify the `flag` variable
     - Since `flag` is declared before `buf` in the function, it's likely at a higher memory address
     - The input string must be long enough to overflow the buffer but not exceed 9 characters (to satisfy constraint #2)
     - The overflow must modify the memory location of `flag` to contain the value 1
     - Typically, this would require an input of 8 bytes to fill the buffer plus additional bytes to reach and modify the `flag` variable

  4. Memory layout constraint:
     - The exact payload depends on the stack layout, but generally:
       - The input must be 8-12 bytes long
       - The last 4 bytes (assuming 32-bit integer) must overwrite the memory location of `flag` with the value 1
       - The input must not contain null bytes that would terminate the string copy early

  5. String termination constraint:
     - The input string must be properly null-terminated for strlen() to work correctly
     - But the strcpy() operation must still overflow the buffer to modify `flag`
