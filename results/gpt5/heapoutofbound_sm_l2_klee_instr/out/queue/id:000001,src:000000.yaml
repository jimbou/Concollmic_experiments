justification: |-
  This branch represents the core logic bomb functionality and has 0% historical coverage (line cov: 0/2). It's triggered when the value at array[symvar] is either negative or greater than 10. 

  The current execution uses "AAAA" as input, which makes symvar = 'A'-48 = 17. This causes an out-of-bounds heap access since the array only has 10 elements. However, the condition isn't triggered because the memory at that location likely contains a value between 0 and 10.

  Exploring this branch would:
  1. Improve code coverage by executing previously uncovered code
  2. Reveal the behavior of the program when the logic bomb is triggered
  3. Exercise a potential security vulnerability (heap out-of-bounds access)

  This is a higher priority than the argc check in main since:
  - It represents the core functionality of the program
  - It involves more complex logic (heap memory access)
  - It has security implications (out-of-bounds memory access)
target_path_constraint: |-
  To reach the target branch `if(array[symvar]<0 || array[symvar]>10) -> true` in the logic_bomb function, we need to satisfy the following constraints:

  1. Program Execution Constraints:
     - The program must be executed with at least one command-line argument (to avoid the `if (argc < 2)` branch in main)

  2. Input Constraints:
     - Let's denote the first command-line argument as `s`
     - The variable `symvar` is computed as `s[0] - 48` (where 48 is the ASCII value of '0')

  3. Array Access and Value Constraints:
     - We need to access `array[symvar]` where `array` is an integer array of size 10
     - Each element `array[k]` is initialized with value `k` for k in [0,9]
     - We need `array[symvar]` to be either < 0 or > 10

  4. Putting it all together:
     - If `0 ≤ symvar ≤ 9`, then `array[symvar] = symvar`, which means `symvar` must be either < 0 or > 10
     - Since `symvar = s[0] - 48`, we need `s[0] - 48 < 0` or `s[0] - 48 > 9`
     - This simplifies to `s[0] < 48` or `s[0] > 57`
     - In other words, the first character of the input string must NOT be a digit ('0' through '9')

  5. Out-of-bounds Access Constraints:
     - If `symvar` is outside [0,9], we're accessing memory outside the allocated array
     - For the condition to be true, this memory must contain a value < 0 or > 10
     - This is non-deterministic as it depends on the memory layout, but we can increase our chances by:
       * Making `symvar` large enough to access memory that's likely uninitialized or contains large values
       * Or making `symvar` negative to access memory before the array that might contain special values

  6. Final Constraint:
     - The first character of the command-line argument should have an ASCII value such that when 48 is subtracted, the result is either:
       a) A large positive number (significantly > 9) to access memory well beyond the array bounds
       b) A negative number to access memory before the array
     - For example, characters with ASCII values much higher than '9' (57) or lower than '0' (48)
