justification: |-
  This branch has 0% historical coverage (line cov: 0/2) and is a critical part of the program's logic. It represents the case where the file provided as an argument exists and can be opened successfully. This branch is particularly important because:

  1. It controls the setting of the `trigger` variable, which in turn determines which execution path is taken later in the program.
  2. Successfully executing this branch would also enable us to reach the `if(trigger)` branch later, which also has 0% coverage.
  3. The branch is not executed in the current trace because the program is run with "AAAA" as an argument, which is not a valid file path.

  Targeting this branch would significantly improve code coverage by potentially covering 4 currently uncovered lines (the 2 lines in this branch plus the 2 lines in the subsequent `if(trigger)` branch).
target_path_constraint: |-
  To reach the target branch `if(fp != NULL) -> true` in the `logic_bomb` function, the following constraints must be satisfied:

  1. The program must be executed with at least one command-line argument (to pass the `if (argc < 2)` check in the main function).

  2. The command-line argument (argv[1]) must be a valid file path that:
     - Exists in the filesystem
     - Has read permissions for the current user
     - Is accessible from the current working directory where the program is executed

  In symbolic terms:
  - argc > 1
  - fopen(argv[1], "r") != NULL

  The key constraint here is that the string passed as the first command-line argument must represent a path to an existing, readable file in the filesystem. The file doesn't need to have any specific content or format - it just needs to exist and be openable for reading.
