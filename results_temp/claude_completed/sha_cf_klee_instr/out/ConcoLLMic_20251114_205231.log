2025-11-14 20:54:14 | INFO | Summarizer agent response: 
Let me look for any implementation files that might contain the SHA1_COMP function:
2025-11-14 20:54:14 | INFO | Summarizer agent calling tool `think`
2025-11-14 20:54:14 | INFO | Thinking process: Based on the execution trace and the code I've seen so far, I need to understand how the SHA1_COMP function works to generate proper constraints. The program appears to be checking if a SHA1 hash of a plaintext matches a predefined cipher.

From the code:
1. The program takes a command line argument (a string)
2. It converts the first character of the string minus 48 (ASCII '0') to an integer called symvar
3. It then passes this integer as plaintext to SHA1_COMP along with a predefined cipher array
4. If SHA1_COMP returns 0 (meaning the hash matches), it triggers the logic bomb

The target branch I want to explore is when SHA1_COMP returns 0, which would trigger the logic bomb.

Since I don't have direct access to the SHA1_COMP implementation, I'll need to make some educated guesses:
- SHA1_COMP likely computes a SHA1 hash of the plaintext and compares it to the cipher
- The cipher array likely contains a precomputed SHA1 hash
- For SHA1_COMP to return 0, the hash of plaintext must match the cipher

The plaintext is derived from s[0] - 48, which means it's converting the first character of the input string to a digit (0-9 if the character is '0' to '9'). So the value of plaintext is limited to a small range of integers.

2025-11-14 20:54:28 | INFO | Target branch selected: if(SHA1_COMP(plaintext,cipher)==0) -> true in sha_cf_klee.c:logic_bomb
Justification: This branch has 0% historical coverage (lines 22-23 have "line cov: 0/2 (0%)") and represents the core functionality of the program - triggering the logic bomb. When this condition is true, the program will execute the code path that prints "Logic bomb triggered" and returns 1. This branch is particularly important because:

1. It's the main security-critical path in the program (the "logic bomb")
2. It has zero historical coverage, meaning no existing test has ever triggered it
3. It depends on a cryptographic comparison, which makes it a challenging and interesting target
4. Successfully reaching this branch would significantly improve the overall test coverage of the project

The branch condition depends on the SHA1_COMP function returning 0, which likely means the SHA1 hash of the plaintext (derived from the first character of the input string) must match the predefined cipher array.

2025-11-14 20:54:55 | INFO | Path constraint generated: To reach the target branch where SHA1_COMP(plaintext,cipher)==0 evaluates to true in the logic_bomb function, the following constraints must be satisfied:

1. Command-line argument constraints:
   - The program must be called with at least one command-line argument (argc >= 2)
   - The first argument (argv[1]) must be a string with at least one character

2. Input value constraints:
   - Let's denote the first character of the input string as s[0]
   - The program computes symvar = s[0] - 48
   - Then plaintext = symvar

3. SHA1 comparison constraint:
   - The SHA1_COMP function compares the SHA1 hash of plaintext with the predefined cipher array
   - For the function to return 0 (indicating a match), the SHA1 hash of plaintext must equal the predefined cipher values:
     cipher[0] = 0X902ba3cd
     cipher[1] = 0Xa1883801
     cipher[2] = 0X594b6e1b
     cipher[3] = 0X452790cc
     cipher[4] = 0X53948fda

4. Specific value constraint:
   - Based on the SHA1 algorithm and the predefined cipher values, plaintext must be a specific value
   - Since plaintext = s[0] - 48, and s[0] is a character in the input string, s[0] must be a character such that when its ASCII value is decreased by 48, the resulting integer produces a SHA1 hash matching the cipher array
   - Given that s[0] - 48 is likely intended to convert a digit character ('0' to '9') to its numeric value (0 to 9), plaintext is likely in the range [0-9]
   - Therefore, s[0] must be a specific digit character that, when converted to its numeric value, produces the SHA1 hash matching the cipher array

In summary, to reach the target branch, the program must be executed with a command-line argument where the first character, when converted to an integer by subtracting 48 from its ASCII value, produces a SHA1 hash that matches the predefined cipher array values.

2025-11-14 20:55:00 | DEBUG | Target branch selection and path constraint summary completed. Result: 

EXPLORATION SUMMARY:

--- Branch 1 ---
TARGET BRANCH:
if(SHA1_COMP(plaintext,cipher)==0) -> true in sha_cf_klee.c:logic_bomb

JUSTIFICATION:
This branch has 0% historical coverage (lines 22-23 have "line cov: 0/2 (0%)") and represents the core functionality of the program - triggering the logic bomb. When this condition is true, the program will execute the code path that prints "Logic bomb triggered" and returns 1. This branch is particularly important because:

1. It's the main security-critical path in the program (the "logic bomb")
2. It has zero historical coverage, meaning no existing test has ever triggered it
3. It depends on a cryptographic comparison, which makes it a challenging and interesting target
4. Successfully reaching this branch would significantly improve the overall test coverage of the project

The branch condition depends on the SHA1_COMP function returning 0, which likely means the SHA1 hash of the plaintext (derived from the first character of the input string) must match the predefined cipher array.

EXPECTED COVERED LINES:
sha_cf_klee.c:22-23

PATH CONSTRAINT:
To reach the target branch where SHA1_COMP(plaintext,cipher)==0 evaluates to true in the logic_bomb function, the following constraints must be satisfied:

1. Command-line argument constraints:
   - The program must be called with at least one command-line argument (argc >= 2)
   - The first argument (argv[1]) must be a string with at least one character

2. Input value constraints:
   - Let's denote the first character of the input string as s[0]
   - The program computes symvar = s[0] - 48
   - Then plaintext = symvar

3. SHA1 comparison constraint:
   - The SHA1_COMP function compares the SHA1 hash of plaintext with the predefined cipher array
   - For the function to return 0 (indicating a match), the SHA1 hash of plaintext must equal the predefined cipher values:
     cipher[0] = 0X902ba3cd
     cipher[1] = 0Xa1883801
     cipher[2] = 0X594b6e1b
     cipher[3] = 0X452790cc
     cipher[4] = 0X53948fda

4. Specific value constraint:
   - Based on the SHA1 algorithm and the predefined cipher values, plaintext must be a specific value
   - Since plaintext = s[0] - 48, and s[0] is a character in the input string, s[0] must be a character such that when its ASCII value is decreased by 48, the resulting integer produces a SHA1 hash matching the cipher array
   - Given that s[0] - 48 is likely intended to convert a digit character ('0' to '9') to its numeric value (0 to 9), plaintext is likely in the range [0-9]
   - Therefore, s[0] must be a specific digit character that, when converted to its numeric value, produces the SHA1 hash matching the cipher array

In summary, to reach the target branch, the program must be executed with a command-line argument where the first character, when converted to an integer by subtracting 48 from its ASCII value, produces a SHA1 hash that matches the predefined cipher array values.

I'll solve this path constraint to generate concrete inputs that will reach the target branch where SHA1_COMP(plaintext,cipher)==0 evaluates to true. Let me break this down step by step.
2025-11-14 20:55:09 | INFO | Solver agent calling tool `think`
2025-11-14 20:55:09 | INFO | Thinking process: Let's analyze the target path constraint:

1. The program needs at least one command-line argument (argc >= 2)
2. The first character of the input string (s[0]) is used to compute a value: symvar = s[0] - 48
3. This value becomes plaintext, which is then hashed using SHA1
4. The SHA1 hash must match a predefined cipher array with these values:
   - cipher[0] = 0X902ba3cd
   - cipher[1] = 0Xa1883801
   - cipher[2] = 0X594b6e1b
   - cipher[3] = 0X452790cc
   - cipher[4] = 0X53948fda

The constraint s[0] - 48 suggests the program is converting a character digit to its numeric value (ASCII '0' is 48, '1' is 49, etc.).

My approach will be:
1. First, I'll need to determine what value of plaintext produces a SHA1 hash matching the cipher array
2. Then I'll work backward to determine what input character s[0] would produce that plaintext value
3. Finally, I'll construct a solution that passes this character as the first character of the command-line argument

Looking at the execution information, the original harness passes "AAAA" as the argument to the executable. I need to modify this to a value where the first character, when converted to an integer (by subtracting 48), produces the correct SHA1 hash.

Let me first write some code to check what plaintext value produces a SHA1 hash matching the cipher array.

Great! I found that the plaintext value `7` produces a SHA1 hash that matches our target cipher values. Let's verify this by comparing the hash with the target cipher values in more detail:

Perfect! I've confirmed that:

1. The plaintext value `7` produces a SHA1 hash that exactly matches our target cipher values.
2. Since the program computes `symvar = s[0] - 48`, and we need `symvar = 7`, the first character of our input string should be `'7'` (ASCII value 55).

Now let's look at the execution harness to understand how to properly provide this input:
2025-11-14 20:55:49 | INFO | Solver agent calling tool `think`
2025-11-14 20:55:49 | INFO | Thinking process: Looking at the execution harness, I see that the program is executed like this:

```python
result = subprocess.run(
    ["./temp_executable AAAA"],
    capture_output=True,
    encoding="utf-8",
    errors="replace",
    shell=True,
    timeout=timeout,
)
```

The command is run with shell=True and the argument "AAAA" is directly appended to the executable path in the command string. To modify this, I need to replace "AAAA" with a string that starts with '7'.

Since we only care about the first character being '7', I could use "7AAA" or just "7" as the argument. However, to be safe and maintain a similar input length, I'll use "7AAA".

The modified command would be:
```
["./temp_executable 7AAA"]
```

Let me create the solution using this approach.
