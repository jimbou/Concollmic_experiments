Justification: This branch has zero historical coverage (0/2, 0%) and represents the core guarded behavior of the program. Exercising the true path of the numeric equality check will flip execution away from the currently covered else-path and increase coverage of the logic_bomb routine. The harness executes the binary with a single string argument; by constraining that argument to parse to exactly the numeric value 7, we can reach this otherwise untested path.

2025-11-18 20:52:18 | INFO | Path constraint generated: Chronological, self-contained constraints to reach the target branch (the true arm of `if (i - 7 == 0)`):

1. Process invocation shape:
   - The program is executed as a command-line binary that expects at least one argument.
   - Ensure exactly one relevant string argument is provided (additional arguments are allowed but the first after the program name is used). The harness already supplies a single argument; we only need to define its content.

2. Argument presence and accessibility:
   - The first command-line argument (a byte string) must be present and readable by the program without environment-specific constraints (no files needed). No special environment variables or permissions are required.

3. Argument encoding and format for numeric parsing:
   - The program parses the first argument using the C standard library function that converts a textual floating-point number to a float (equivalent to `atof`).
   - Therefore, the argument must be a valid ASCII/UTF-8 textual representation of a floating-point number according to C locale rules. Allowed forms include optional leading/trailing whitespace, an optional sign (+ or -), digits, an optional decimal point with digits, and optionally an exponent part (e.g., `e` or `E` followed by an optional sign and digits).
   - Parsing stops at the first character that is not part of the numeric format; any trailing non-numeric characters are ignored for the numeric value.

4. Numeric value constraint (to satisfy `i - 7 == 0`):
   - Let V be the numeric value produced by parsing the argument with C `atof`.
   - Constraint: V must be exactly equal to the floating-point value 7.0 in the target's `float` precision after conversion.
   - In practice, this means the textual representation must correspond to 7.0 under standard decimal-to-binary rounding for IEEE-754 float. The decimal 7 is exactly representable in binary float, so any canonical representation of seven (with optional whitespace/sign, optional `.0`, or exponent that yields 7) satisfies this.
   - Do not include any leading characters that prevent `atof` from parsing any number; the first non-whitespace character must start a valid number that evaluates to 7.0.

5. Equality semantics:
   - The check is a direct arithmetic comparison `i - 7 == 0` in float. Because 7.0 is exactly representable, the parsed float must equal exactly 7.0. Avoid representations that would parse to a value other than 7 (e.g., `7.0001`, `6.9999999`, `7e-1`, etc.).

No additional I/O or environmental constraints apply.

2025-11-18 20:52:32 | DEBUG | Target branch selection and path constraint summary completed. Result: 

EXPLORATION SUMMARY:

--- Branch 1 ---
TARGET BRANCH:
if (i - 7 == 0) -> true in atof_ef_l2_klee.c:logic_bomb

JUSTIFICATION:
This branch has zero historical coverage (0/2, 0%) and represents the core guarded behavior of the program. Exercising the true path of the numeric equality check will flip execution away from the currently covered else-path and increase coverage of the logic_bomb routine. The harness executes the binary with a single string argument; by constraining that argument to parse to exactly the numeric value 7, we can reach this otherwise untested path.

EXPECTED COVERED LINES:
atof_ef_l2_klee.c:14-15

PATH CONSTRAINT:
Chronological, self-contained constraints to reach the target branch (the true arm of `if (i - 7 == 0)`):

1. Process invocation shape:
   - The program is executed as a command-line binary that expects at least one argument.
   - Ensure exactly one relevant string argument is provided (additional arguments are allowed but the first after the program name is used). The harness already supplies a single argument; we only need to define its content.

2. Argument presence and accessibility:
   - The first command-line argument (a byte string) must be present and readable by the program without environment-specific constraints (no files needed). No special environment variables or permissions are required.

3. Argument encoding and format for numeric parsing:
   - The program parses the first argument using the C standard library function that converts a textual floating-point number to a float (equivalent to `atof`).
   - Therefore, the argument must be a valid ASCII/UTF-8 textual representation of a floating-point number according to C locale rules. Allowed forms include optional leading/trailing whitespace, an optional sign (+ or -), digits, an optional decimal point with digits, and optionally an exponent part (e.g., `e` or `E` followed by an optional sign and digits).
   - Parsing stops at the first character that is not part of the numeric format; any trailing non-numeric characters are ignored for the numeric value.

4. Numeric value constraint (to satisfy `i - 7 == 0`):
   - Let V be the numeric value produced by parsing the argument with C `atof`.
   - Constraint: V must be exactly equal to the floating-point value 7.0 in the target's `float` precision after conversion.
   - In practice, this means the textual representation must correspond to 7.0 under standard decimal-to-binary rounding for IEEE-754 float. The decimal 7 is exactly representable in binary float, so any canonical representation of seven (with optional whitespace/sign, optional `.0`, or exponent that yields 7) satisfies this.
   - Do not include any leading characters that prevent `atof` from parsing any number; the first non-whitespace character must start a valid number that evaluates to 7.0.

5. Equality semantics:
   - The check is a direct arithmetic comparison `i - 7 == 0` in float. Because 7.0 is exactly representable, the parsed float must equal exactly 7.0. Avoid representations that would parse to a value other than 7 (e.g., `7.0001`, `6.9999999`, `7e-1`, etc.).

No additional I/O or environmental constraints apply.

2025-11-18 20:53:32 | INFO | Target branch selected: if (i - 7 == 0) -> true in atof_ef_l2_klee.c:logic_bomb
Justification: This branch was not taken in the current execution (the else path printed "Path without the bomb"). While the true branch shows 100% historical coverage, the only other unexecuted branch with 0% coverage is `if (argc < 2)` in main, which is unreachable under the fixed harness that always supplies one argument. Therefore, the most impactful reachable alternative path is to trigger the core condition `atof(symvar) == 7`, which exercises the program’s primary decision point and yields different behavior. Selecting this branch aligns with the harness constraints and will diversify execution paths beyond the current run.

2025-11-18 20:54:17 | INFO | Summarizer agent calling tool `generate_path_constraint`
2025-11-18 20:54:17 | INFO | Path constraint generated: Chronological external input and environment constraints to reach the selected branch (i − 7 == 0) evaluating to true in logic_bomb:

1) Process invocation shape (command-line interface):
   - The program must be executed as a process with at least 2 command-line arguments: the executable name and one additional string argument. The harness already provides one argument string positionally as argv[1]. No environment variables are required.

2) Argument count feasibility under the harness:
   - Ensure the harness continues to pass exactly one non-empty argument as argv[1]. This satisfies the precondition that argc ≥ 2, so execution reaches logic_bomb.

3) Encoding and parsing assumptions for the argument string:
   - The argument at argv[1] is interpreted as a C string encoded in ASCII/UTF-8 without embedded NUL bytes before the end of the numeric text. Only characters up to the first NUL byte are parsed.
   - The string is interpreted by the standard ASCII-to-float conversion per atof: it skips leading whitespace, then reads an optional sign (+/−), a sequence of decimal digits possibly containing a single decimal point, and an optional exponent part (e or E followed by an optional sign and digits). Parsing stops at the first character not part of this grammar. If no digits are found, the value is 0.

4) Numeric value constraint required by the target branch:
   - The numeric value produced by atof from argv[1] must be exactly equal to 7 in floating-point (single-precision float is assigned from atof’s double result). Acceptable textual forms include any that atof recognizes and that evaluate to the mathematical value seven. Symbolically: atof(argv[1]) == 7.0.

5) Robustness against trailing characters:
   - Trailing non-numeric characters are permitted after the parsed numeric prefix, but they must not change the parsed value. Therefore, the prefix of argv[1] up to the first non-numeric character must parse to seven as per atof’s grammar in (3).

6) No reliance on locale-specific decimal separators:
   - The runtime locale must use '.' as the decimal separator (C/POSIX locale assumption). If locales could vary, force or assume the C locale so that representations like "7", "+7", "7.0", or "7e0" are parsed as seven.

Summary symbolic constraint:
   - argv[1] is a valid numeric string s under atof such that value(s) = 7.0 exactly when converted to float: atof(s) == 7.0f.

EXPLORATION SUMMARY:

--- Branch 1 ---
TARGET BRANCH:
if (i - 7 == 0) -> true in atof_ef_l2_klee.c:logic_bomb

JUSTIFICATION:
This branch was not taken in the current execution (the else path printed "Path without the bomb"). While the true branch shows 100% historical coverage, the only other unexecuted branch with 0% coverage is `if (argc < 2)` in main, which is unreachable under the fixed harness that always supplies one argument. Therefore, the most impactful reachable alternative path is to trigger the core condition `atof(symvar) == 7`, which exercises the program’s primary decision point and yields different behavior. Selecting this branch aligns with the harness constraints and will diversify execution paths beyond the current run.

EXPECTED COVERED LINES:
atof_ef_l2_klee.c:14-15

PATH CONSTRAINT:
Chronological external input and environment constraints to reach the selected branch (i − 7 == 0) evaluating to true in logic_bomb:

1) Process invocation shape (command-line interface):
   - The program must be executed as a process with at least 2 command-line arguments: the executable name and one additional string argument. The harness already provides one argument string positionally as argv[1]. No environment variables are required.

2) Argument count feasibility under the harness:
   - Ensure the harness continues to pass exactly one non-empty argument as argv[1]. This satisfies the precondition that argc ≥ 2, so execution reaches logic_bomb.

3) Encoding and parsing assumptions for the argument string:
   - The argument at argv[1] is interpreted as a C string encoded in ASCII/UTF-8 without embedded NUL bytes before the end of the numeric text. Only characters up to the first NUL byte are parsed.
   - The string is interpreted by the standard ASCII-to-float conversion per atof: it skips leading whitespace, then reads an optional sign (+/−), a sequence of decimal digits possibly containing a single decimal point, and an optional exponent part (e or E followed by an optional sign and digits). Parsing stops at the first character not part of this grammar. If no digits are found, the value is 0.

4) Numeric value constraint required by the target branch:
   - The numeric value produced by atof from argv[1] must be exactly equal to 7 in floating-point (single-precision float is assigned from atof’s double result). Acceptable textual forms include any that atof recognizes and that evaluate to the mathematical value seven. Symbolically: atof(argv[1]) == 7.0.

5) Robustness against trailing characters:
   - Trailing non-numeric characters are permitted after the parsed numeric prefix, but they must not change the parsed value. Therefore, the prefix of argv[1] up to the first non-numeric character must parse to seven as per atof’s grammar in (3).

6) No reliance on locale-specific decimal separators:
   - The runtime locale must use '.' as the decimal separator (C/POSIX locale assumption). If locales could vary, force or assume the C locale so that representations like "7", "+7", "7.0", or "7e0" are parsed as seven.

Summary symbolic constraint:
   - argv[1] is a valid numeric string s under atof such that value(s) = 7.0 exactly when converted to float: atof(s) == 7.0f.

2025-11-18 20:55:34 | INFO | Target branch selected: if (i - 7 == 0) -> true in atof_ef_l2_klee.c:logic_bomb
Justification: This is the only branch controllable via external input (the program’s first command-line argument). While the branch body shows 100% historical coverage (lines 14-15), it was not taken in the current run, and the only other unexecuted branch (argc < 2 in main) has 0% historical coverage but is unreachable with the fixed harness that always supplies one argument. Exercising this branch will drive execution down the alternative path of the core check in logic_bomb and is the most feasible coverage-improving action under the current harness constraints.

2025-11-18 20:56:17 | INFO | Path constraint generated: Constraints to reach the target branch (i - 7 == 0) -> true in logic_bomb:

1. Command invocation and argument count:
   - The program must be executed with at least one command-line argument. The harness already invokes the binary with exactly one argument string; no change is required to the number of arguments.

2. Argument content and parseability as a floating-point number:
   - The first command-line argument (argv[1]) must be a string that standard C atof recognizes as a valid floating-point number in decimal notation.
   - Acceptable formats include optional leading/trailing whitespace, an optional sign (+ or -), digits with an optional decimal point, and optional exponent part (e.g., "7", "7.0", "+7", "7e0", "  7  ").
   - The string must not be empty and should not contain leading non-numeric characters that would cause atof to return 0.0.

3. Numerical equality constraint after parsing:
   - Let i be the double-precision value produced by atof on the argument string.
   - The value must satisfy i == 7.0 exactly (as a double), ensuring that the expression (i - 7) evaluates to 0.
   - To avoid floating-point representation issues, the textual representation should correspond to an exact IEEE-754 double for 7.0 (which common decimal forms like "7", "7.0", or "7e0" do).

4. Environment and encoding:
   - The argument string must be encoded in UTF-8 (the harness uses text mode with UTF-8 encoding and errors="replace").
   - No environment restrictions beyond standard execution; the process must be allowed to execute normally without signals or timeouts.

These constraints ensure that logic_bomb computes i = atof(argv[1]) as 7.0 and thus takes the true branch (i - 7 == 0).

EXPLORATION SUMMARY:

--- Branch 1 ---
TARGET BRANCH:
if (i - 7 == 0) -> true in atof_ef_l2_klee.c:logic_bomb

JUSTIFICATION:
This is the only branch controllable via external input (the program’s first command-line argument). While the branch body shows 100% historical coverage (lines 14-15), it was not taken in the current run, and the only other unexecuted branch (argc < 2 in main) has 0% historical coverage but is unreachable with the fixed harness that always supplies one argument. Exercising this branch will drive execution down the alternative path of the core check in logic_bomb and is the most feasible coverage-improving action under the current harness constraints.

EXPECTED COVERED LINES:
atof_ef_l2_klee.c:14-15

PATH CONSTRAINT:
Constraints to reach the target branch (i - 7 == 0) -> true in logic_bomb:

1. Command invocation and argument count:
   - The program must be executed with at least one command-line argument. The harness already invokes the binary with exactly one argument string; no change is required to the number of arguments.

2. Argument content and parseability as a floating-point number:
   - The first command-line argument (argv[1]) must be a string that standard C atof recognizes as a valid floating-point number in decimal notation.
   - Acceptable formats include optional leading/trailing whitespace, an optional sign (+ or -), digits with an optional decimal point, and optional exponent part (e.g., "7", "7.0", "+7", "7e0", "  7  ").
   - The string must not be empty and should not contain leading non-numeric characters that would cause atof to return 0.0.

3. Numerical equality constraint after parsing:
   - Let i be the double-precision value produced by atof on the argument string.
   - The value must satisfy i == 7.0 exactly (as a double), ensuring that the expression (i - 7) evaluates to 0.
   - To avoid floating-point representation issues, the textual representation should correspond to an exact IEEE-754 double for 7.0 (which common decimal forms like "7", "7.0", or "7e0" do).

4. Environment and encoding:
   - The argument string must be encoded in UTF-8 (the harness uses text mode with UTF-8 encoding and errors="replace").
   - No environment restrictions beyond standard execution; the process must be allowed to execute normally without signals or timeouts.

These constraints ensure that logic_bomb computes i = atof(argv[1]) as 7.0 and thus takes the true branch (i - 7 == 0).
