2025-11-17 21:14:26 | INFO | Target branch selected: if (array[symvar % 10] == 7) -> false in malloc_sm_l1_klee.c:logic_bomb
Justification: This branch’s false path was not taken in the current execution: the program received "AAAA", which makes s[0] = 'A' (65), symvar = 65 - 48 = 17, and symvar % 10 = 7, so the true path executed and the function returned early. The lines immediately after the if (reported as unexecuted lines 22-23 with 0/2 coverage) were skipped. Exercising the false path will cover these lines and demonstrate the program’s normal, non-bomb behavior, improving overall coverage for this file. Historical coverage annotation shows 0% for lines 22-23, indicating this path has not been covered.

2025-11-17 21:15:02 | INFO | Path constraint generated: Input and environment constraints to force the branch `if (array[symvar % 10] == 7)` to evaluate to FALSE in logic_bomb:

1) Command invocation format
- The harness will execute a single program "./temp_executable" with exactly one string argument. Do not alter the number of arguments.
- The program must receive one ASCII string argument s, with length at least 1 (the code only reads s[0]).

2) Encoding and character domain for s[0]
- s[0] is interpreted as an ASCII character whose decimal code is used to compute symvar = (ASCII_code(s[0]) - 48).
- Therefore, select s[0] so that (ASCII_code(s[0]) - 48) % 10 != 7.
- Equivalently: ASCII_code(s[0]) % 10 != 5.

3) No other environmental requirements
- Memory allocation of a fixed-size int array succeeds under normal environments; no special permissions or files are needed.

Rationale linking to program path:
- The array is initialized as array[k] = k for k in 0..9, so array[i] == i for any i in {0..9}.
- The condition checks if array[symvar % 10] == 7, which is equivalent to checking if (symvar % 10) == 7.
- To force FALSE, ensure (symvar % 10) != 7, i.e., (ASCII_code(s[0]) - 48) % 10 != 7.

Chronological execution order summary:
- Program starts and reads argv[1] as s.
- Compute symvar = ASCII_code(s[0]) - 48.
- Compute idx = symvar % 10.
- Require idx != 7 to ensure branch is false and the lines after the if-statement execute.

EXPLORATION SUMMARY:

--- Branch 1 ---
TARGET BRANCH:
if (array[symvar % 10] == 7) -> false in malloc_sm_l1_klee.c:logic_bomb

JUSTIFICATION:
This branch’s false path was not taken in the current execution: the program received "AAAA", which makes s[0] = 'A' (65), symvar = 65 - 48 = 17, and symvar % 10 = 7, so the true path executed and the function returned early. The lines immediately after the if (reported as unexecuted lines 22-23 with 0/2 coverage) were skipped. Exercising the false path will cover these lines and demonstrate the program’s normal, non-bomb behavior, improving overall coverage for this file. Historical coverage annotation shows 0% for lines 22-23, indicating this path has not been covered.

EXPECTED COVERED LINES:
malloc_sm_l1_klee.c:22-23

PATH CONSTRAINT:
Input and environment constraints to force the branch `if (array[symvar % 10] == 7)` to evaluate to FALSE in logic_bomb:

1) Command invocation format
- The harness will execute a single program "./temp_executable" with exactly one string argument. Do not alter the number of arguments.
- The program must receive one ASCII string argument s, with length at least 1 (the code only reads s[0]).

2) Encoding and character domain for s[0]
- s[0] is interpreted as an ASCII character whose decimal code is used to compute symvar = (ASCII_code(s[0]) - 48).
- Therefore, select s[0] so that (ASCII_code(s[0]) - 48) % 10 != 7.
- Equivalently: ASCII_code(s[0]) % 10 != 5.

3) No other environmental requirements
- Memory allocation of a fixed-size int array succeeds under normal environments; no special permissions or files are needed.

Rationale linking to program path:
- The array is initialized as array[k] = k for k in 0..9, so array[i] == i for any i in {0..9}.
- The condition checks if array[symvar % 10] == 7, which is equivalent to checking if (symvar % 10) == 7.
- To force FALSE, ensure (symvar % 10) != 7, i.e., (ASCII_code(s[0]) - 48) % 10 != 7.

Chronological execution order summary:
- Program starts and reads argv[1] as s.
- Compute symvar = ASCII_code(s[0]) - 48.

2025-11-17 21:17:44 | INFO | Target branch selected: if (array[symvar % 10] == 7) -> false in malloc_sm_l1_klee.c:logic_bomb
Justification: The current execution took the true branch (logic bomb triggered). The only other conditional in this program is argc < 2, whose error path (lines 28-29) shows zero historical coverage but is unreachable with the fixed harness that always supplies one argument. Therefore, the most viable branch to diversify behavior and improve path coverage under the existing harness is the false branch of the array-index check, which will exercise the non-bomb path. While lines 22-23 show 100% historical coverage, this path was not executed in the current trace and is the only reachable alternative path given the harness constraints.

2025-11-17 21:18:24 | INFO | Path constraint generated: Inputs and environment to reach: if (array[symvar % 10] == 7) evaluates to false inside logic_bomb, thereby taking the non-bomb path.

Chronological constraints:
1) Program invocation (command-line): The test harness invokes the executable with exactly one command-line argument string. Do not alter the harness behavior; it already provides one string argument. Ensure the process environment permits execution (no special env vars required). The program must receive argc >= 2 (satisfies harness).

2) Argument length and encoding: The program expects an ASCII-compatible byte string of length at least 1 (metadata comment indicates expected length 4, but only s[0] is read). Bytes are interpreted as unsigned 8-bit characters.

3) First-byte numeric mapping: The program computes symvar = s[0] - 48, where 48 is the ASCII code for character '0'. It then computes index = symvar mod 10. The allocated array is initialized with array[k] = k for k in 0..9, so array[index] equals index. The conditional is array[index] == 7.

4) Branch-false requirement (non-bomb path): Require that array[index] != 7, i.e., (symvar mod 10) != 7. In terms of the first byte b = s[0] (0..255), let symvar = b - 48. Then the constraint is ((b - 48) mod 10) != 7.

5) Safety/domain constraints to avoid undefined behavior:
   - The index used is (b - 48) mod 10, which always yields a value in 0..9 for any byte b, so there is no out-of-bounds risk regardless of b. No other constraints on remaining bytes are needed.
   - The program reads no further input from the argument; characters s[1..] do not affect the branch.

Summary of required constraints on the command-line argument:
- Provide a non-empty string argument (at least 1 byte).
- Let b be the numeric value of the first byte (0..255). Enforce ((b - 48) mod 10) != 7. No constraints on the remaining bytes.

EXPLORATION SUMMARY:

--- Branch 1 ---
TARGET BRANCH:
if (array[symvar % 10] == 7) -> false in malloc_sm_l1_klee.c:logic_bomb

JUSTIFICATION:
The current execution took the true branch (logic bomb triggered). The only other conditional in this program is argc < 2, whose error path (lines 28-29) shows zero historical coverage but is unreachable with the fixed harness that always supplies one argument. Therefore, the most viable branch to diversify behavior and improve path coverage under the existing harness is the false branch of the array-index check, which will exercise the non-bomb path. While lines 22-23 show 100% historical coverage, this path was not executed in the current trace and is the only reachable alternative path given the harness constraints.

EXPECTED COVERED LINES:
malloc_sm_l1_klee.c:22-23

PATH CONSTRAINT:
Inputs and environment to reach: if (array[symvar % 10] == 7) evaluates to false inside logic_bomb, thereby taking the non-bomb path.

Chronological constraints:
1) Program invocation (command-line): The test harness invokes the executable with exactly one command-line argument string. Do not alter the harness behavior; it already provides one string argument. Ensure the process environment permits execution (no special env vars required). The program must receive argc >= 2 (satisfies harness).

2) Argument length and encoding: The program expects an ASCII-compatible byte string of length at least 1 (metadata comment indicates expected length 4, but only s[0] is read). Bytes are interpreted as unsigned 8-bit characters.

3) First-byte numeric mapping: The program computes symvar = s[0] - 48, where 48 is the ASCII code for character '0'. It then computes index = symvar mod 10. The allocated array is initialized with array[k] = k for k in 0..9, so array[index] equals index. The conditional is array[index] == 7.

4) Branch-false requirement (non-bomb path): Require that array[index] != 7, i.e., (symvar mod 10) != 7. In terms of the first byte b = s[0] (0..255), let symvar = b - 48. Then the constraint is ((b - 48) mod 10) != 7.

5) Safety/domain constraints to avoid undefined behavior:
   - The index used is (b - 48) mod 10, which always yields a value in 0..9 for any byte b, so there is no out-of-bounds risk regardless of b. No other constraints on remaining bytes are needed.
   - The program reads no further input from the argument; characters s[1..] do not affect the branch.

Summary of required constraints on the command-line argument:
- Provide a non-empty string argument (at least 1 byte).
- Let b be the numeric value of the first byte (0..255). Enforce ((b - 48) mod 10) != 7. No constraints on the remaining bytes.
