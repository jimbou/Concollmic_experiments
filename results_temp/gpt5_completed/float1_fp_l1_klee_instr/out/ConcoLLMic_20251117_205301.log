2025-11-17 20:54:40 | INFO | Target branch selected: if (a - b == 0) -> true in float1_fp_l1_klee.c:logic_bomb
Justification: This nested branch guards the program’s core “bomb” behavior and currently has 0% historical coverage (Unexecuted code lines 14-15). Exercising it will definitively increase coverage beyond the already-taken outer branch (a != 0.1). The branch is reachable by controlling the first byte of the single command-line string argument so that the computed float a equals b at float precision, which causes (a - b) to be exactly 0 after usual promotions.

2025-11-17 20:55:24 | INFO | Summarizer agent calling tool `generate_path_constraint`
2025-11-17 20:55:24 | INFO | Path constraint generated: Program interface and invocation:
- The program is executed as a native binary named temp_executable and receives exactly one command-line argument: a string s of length 4 bytes (no spaces required because the harness wraps it as a single shell argument). Only s[0] (the first byte) influences the path.

Environmental and invocation constraints:
1) Argument count: The process must be started with at least one argument beyond argv[0] (the program name). The harness already supplies one argument, so no additional constraints are needed here.

Input string structure and encoding:
2) The single argument s is a sequence of 4 bytes. Treat s as ASCII bytes; only the first byte is used. Let c denote the numeric value of the first byte, i.e., c = s[0] interpreted as unsigned char.

Semantic mapping performed by the program:
- The program computes an integer symvar = c - 48, then computes a = symvar / 70.0 as a 32-bit IEEE-754 float, and sets b = 0.1 (float).

Path constraints to reach the target branch (a - b == 0):
3) Ensure the outer guard a != 0.1 evaluates to true to enter the nested condition. Given float rounding, require that the float value of a differs from the float value of 0.1. This is automatically satisfied by any c that does not make a exactly the same float as 0.1; see (4) for the precise condition we need.
4) Make (a - b) equal to 0 in float arithmetic. Since both a and b are float, this is equivalent to requiring a and b to have exactly identical float representations. Therefore require that a equals b as a 32-bit IEEE-754 float.
   - Given a = (c - 48) / 70.0f, b = 0.1f, the constraint is: float32((c - 48) / 70.0) == float32(0.1).
   - Here float32(x) means x rounded to the nearest-even representable 32-bit IEEE-754 float.

Domain restrictions for c:
5) c is a byte: 0 <= c <= 255. Additionally, the observed harness uses the literal string "AAAA" (0x41 0x41 0x41 0x41), but to explore new paths you must allow c to vary arbitrarily within [0,255]. The remaining three bytes of s may be any values and do not affect control flow.

SMT-LIB compatible formulation (if needed):
- Declare an 8-bit bitvector C for the first byte, promote to an integer I = bv2nat(C), define SYMVAR = I - 48, and define A = fp.roundToIntegral(RNE, (to_fp 8 24) (SYMVAR / 70.0)) is not appropriate; instead directly:
   (declare-const C (_ BitVec 8))
   (define-fun I () Int (bv2nat C))
   (define-fun SYMVAR () Int (- I 48))
   (define-fun A () Float32 (fp.from_real RNE (/ (to_real SYMVAR) 70.0)))
   (define-fun B () Float32 (fp.from_real RNE 0.1))
   (assert (= A B))
   (Optional) To ensure the outer guard a != 0.1 is satisfied in source-level semantics, equality on float here suffices; subtraction equals zero follows from equality under IEEE-754.

Summary of requirements for test generation:
- Provide any 4-byte command-line string s where the first byte value c satisfies: the 32-bit float of (c - 48)/70 equals the 32-bit float representation of 0.1. Other bytes unrestricted.

EXPLORATION SUMMARY:

--- Branch 1 ---
TARGET BRANCH:
if (a - b == 0) -> true in float1_fp_l1_klee.c:logic_bomb

JUSTIFICATION:
This nested branch guards the program’s core “bomb” behavior and currently has 0% historical coverage (Unexecuted code lines 14-15). Exercising it will definitively increase coverage beyond the already-taken outer branch (a != 0.1). The branch is reachable by controlling the first byte of the single command-line string argument so that the computed float a equals b at float precision, which causes (a - b) to be exactly 0 after usual promotions.

EXPECTED COVERED LINES:
float1_fp_l1_klee.c:14-15

PATH CONSTRAINT:
Program interface and invocation:
- The program is executed as a native binary named temp_executable and receives exactly one command-line argument: a string s of length 4 bytes (no spaces required because the harness wraps it as a single shell argument). Only s[0] (the first byte) influences the path.

Environmental and invocation constraints:
1) Argument count: The process must be started with at least one argument beyond argv[0] (the program name). The harness already supplies one argument, so no additional constraints are needed here.

Input string structure and encoding:
2) The single argument s is a sequence of 4 bytes. Treat s as ASCII bytes; only the first byte is used. Let c denote the numeric value of the first byte, i.e., c = s[0] interpreted as unsigned char.

Semantic mapping performed by the program:
- The program computes an integer symvar = c - 48, then computes a = symvar / 70.0 as a 32-bit IEEE-754 float, and sets b = 0.1 (float).

Path constraints to reach the target branch (a - b == 0):
3) Ensure the outer guard a != 0.1 evaluates to true to enter the nested condition. Given float rounding, require that the float value of a differs from the float value of 0.1. This is automatically satisfied by any c that does not make a exactly the same float as 0.1; see (4) for the precise condition we need.
4) Make (a - b) equal to 0 in float arithmetic. Since both a and b are float, this is equivalent to requiring a and b to have exactly identical float representations. Therefore require that a equals b as a 32-bit IEEE-754 float.
   - Given a = (c - 48) / 70.0f, b = 0.1f, the constraint is: float32((c - 48) / 70.0) == float32(0.1).
   - Here float32(x) means x rounded to the nearest-even representable 32-bit IEEE-754 float.

Domain restrictions for c:
5) c is a byte: 0 <= c <= 255. Additionally, the observed harness uses the literal string "AAAA" (0x41 0x41 0x41 0x41), but to explore new paths you must allow c to vary arbitrarily within [0,255]. The remaining three bytes of s may be any values and do not affect control flow.

SMT-LIB compatible formulation (if needed):
- Declare an 8-bit bitvector C for the first byte, promote to an integer I = bv2nat(C), define SYMVAR = I - 48, and define A = fp.roundToIntegral(RNE, (to_fp 8 24) (SYMVAR / 70.0)) is not appropriate; instead directly:
   (declare-const C (_ BitVec 8))
   (define-fun I () Int (bv2nat C))
   (define-fun SYMVAR () Int (- I 48))
   (define-fun A () Float32 (fp.from_real RNE (/ (to_real SYMVAR) 70.0)))
   (define-fun B () Float32 (fp.from_real RNE 0.1))
   (assert (= A B))
   (Optional) To ensure the outer guard a != 0.1 is satisfied in source-level semantics, equality on float here suffices; subtraction equals zero follows from equality under IEEE-754.

Summary of requirements for test generation:
- Provide any 4-byte command-line string s where the first byte value c satisfies: the 32-bit float of (c - 48)/70 equals the 32-bit float representation of 0.1. Other bytes unrestricted.

2025-11-17 20:57:33 | INFO | Path constraint generated: Constraints to reach: main: if (argc < 2) -> true.

1. Process invocation (command-line argument count):
   - Launch the executable without any user-supplied arguments. The operating system will still pass argv[0] (the program name), so the total argc must equal 1. Constraint: argc == 1.

2. Shell/harness behavior:
   - Ensure the harness does not wrap the executable in a way that adds positional arguments. If a shell is used, the command string MUST NOT include any tokens after the program path. Constraint: the command line contains only the program path, with no spaces or additional tokens.

3. Environment conditions:
   - No environment variable expansion or alias should append arguments automatically. Constraint: the execution environment must not prepend or append extra argv entries via wrappers (e.g., no exec alias adding default args).

These conditions guarantee that on process start, argc < 2 evaluates to true, taking the target branch body.

EXPLORATION SUMMARY:

--- Branch 1 ---
TARGET BRANCH:
if (argc < 2) -> true in float1_fp_l1_klee.c:main

JUSTIFICATION:
This branch has zero historical coverage according to the trace (lines 25-26: 0/2, 0%). Exercising it explores the error/usage path when no user argument is provided, which is a distinct top-level behavior from the current run (which provided one argument and entered logic_bomb). Covering this branch increases overall coverage in main and validates input handling for missing arguments.

EXPECTED COVERED LINES:
float1_fp_l1_klee.c:25-26

PATH CONSTRAINT:
Constraints to reach: main: if (argc < 2) -> true.

1. Process invocation (command-line argument count):
   - Launch the executable without any user-supplied arguments. The operating system will still pass argv[0] (the program name), so the total argc must equal 1. Constraint: argc == 1.

2. Shell/harness behavior:
   - Ensure the harness does not wrap the executable in a way that adds positional arguments. If a shell is used, the command string MUST NOT include any tokens after the program path. Constraint: the command line contains only the program path, with no spaces or additional tokens.

3. Environment conditions:
   - No environment variable expansion or alias should append arguments automatically. Constraint: the execution environment must not prepend or append extra argv entries via wrappers (e.g., no exec alias adding default args).

These conditions guarantee that on process start, argc < 2 evaluates to true, taking the target branch body.

Justification: This nested branch triggers the program’s distinctive behavior (prints "Logic bomb triggered" and returns 1). It was not executed in the current run because the harness provided no arguments and exited early in main. While historical coverage indicates these lines have been covered, there are no uncovered/low-coverage alternatives visible in this file, and exercising this path will explore a completely different behavior than the current trace (which only executed the argc<2 usage path). Reaching this branch ensures logic involving floating-point comparisons is exercised.

2025-11-17 21:00:35 | INFO | Path constraint generated: Chronological, input-level constraints to reach logic_bomb’s nested branch (a != 0.1) -> true and (a - b == 0) -> true:

1) Command invocation and argument count:
   - The executable must be invoked with exactly one user-supplied positional argument after the program name, so that argc == 2 and argv[1] exists.
   - No additional arguments or options may be present.

2) Argument encoding and length:
   - argv[1] must be a byte string representing an input string; ASCII is acceptable.
   - The program accesses s[0] only, and a comment indicates {"s":{"length": 4}}; to avoid undefined behavior and match expectations, ensure the input string length is at least 4 bytes (not counting any terminating null added by the execution environment). Additional bytes are allowed.

3) First-byte numeric constraint to drive floating-point path:
   - The program computes symvar = (s[0] - 48), a = symvar / 70.0, and sets b = 0.1.
   - We must satisfy simultaneously:
     (i) a != 0.1
     (ii) a - b == 0  (where b == 0.1)
   - Combining (ii) with b == 0.1 gives a == 0.1, which contradicts (i). Therefore, these two conditions can only be both true if floating-point representation/rounding causes (a != 0.1) to be true while (a - 0.1) == 0 evaluates true due to exact binary representation alignment of a with b at the subtraction step.
   - To achieve this, impose the following precise constraint on s[0]:
     • Let x := s[0] be the unsigned byte value of the first character.
     • Define symvar := x - 48.
     • Define a := symvar / 70.0 in IEEE-754 single-precision evaluation (as in C float), and b := 0.1f (single-precision constant).
     • Require that a, when stored as float, is not bitwise equal to the float representation of 0.1f (so a != 0.1 is true under C float comparison).
     • Additionally require that subtracting b from a in float arithmetic yields exactly +0.0f, i.e., (a - b) == 0 under C float comparison.
   - These constraints imply s[0] must be a byte such that (x - 48)/70.0f is a float very close to 0.1f: equal after subtraction but not equal under direct comparison due to precision/rounding asymmetry.

4) Byte-domain bounds to keep symvar well-defined:
   - s[0] must be a valid ASCII digit or nearby byte so that (x - 48) is a small integer; any byte 0..255 is allowed, but choose values that do not cause undefined behavior. No additional characters affect the path, as only s[0] is read.

5) Environment assumptions:
   - No special files or environment variables are required.
   - Standard IEEE-754 single-precision float semantics must apply (typical C float on mainstream platforms).

2025-11-17 21:01:02 | DEBUG | Target branch selection and path constraint summary completed. Result: 

EXPLORATION SUMMARY:

--- Branch 1 ---
TARGET BRANCH:
In logic_bomb(char* s): nested branch where (a != 0.1) -> true and then (a - b == 0) -> true

JUSTIFICATION:
This nested branch triggers the program’s distinctive behavior (prints "Logic bomb triggered" and returns 1). It was not executed in the current run because the harness provided no arguments and exited early in main. While historical coverage indicates these lines have been covered, there are no uncovered/low-coverage alternatives visible in this file, and exercising this path will explore a completely different behavior than the current trace (which only executed the argc<2 usage path). Reaching this branch ensures logic involving floating-point comparisons is exercised.

EXPECTED COVERED LINES:
float1_fp_l1_klee.c:14-15

PATH CONSTRAINT:
Chronological, input-level constraints to reach logic_bomb’s nested branch (a != 0.1) -> true and (a - b == 0) -> true:

1) Command invocation and argument count:
   - The executable must be invoked with exactly one user-supplied positional argument after the program name, so that argc == 2 and argv[1] exists.
   - No additional arguments or options may be present.

2) Argument encoding and length:
   - argv[1] must be a byte string representing an input string; ASCII is acceptable.
   - The program accesses s[0] only, and a comment indicates {"s":{"length": 4}}; to avoid undefined behavior and match expectations, ensure the input string length is at least 4 bytes (not counting any terminating null added by the execution environment). Additional bytes are allowed.

3) First-byte numeric constraint to drive floating-point path:
   - The program computes symvar = (s[0] - 48), a = symvar / 70.0, and sets b = 0.1.
   - We must satisfy simultaneously:
     (i) a != 0.1
     (ii) a - b == 0  (where b == 0.1)
   - Combining (ii) with b == 0.1 gives a == 0.1, which contradicts (i). Therefore, these two conditions can only be both true if floating-point representation/rounding causes (a != 0.1) to be true while (a - 0.1) == 0 evaluates true due to exact binary representation alignment of a with b at the subtraction step.
   - To achieve this, impose the following precise constraint on s[0]:
     • Let x := s[0] be the unsigned byte value of the first character.
     • Define symvar := x - 48.
     • Define a := symvar / 70.0 in IEEE-754 single-precision evaluation (as in C float), and b := 0.1f (single-precision constant).
     • Require that a, when stored as float, is not bitwise equal to the float representation of 0.1f (so a != 0.1 is true under C float comparison).
     • Additionally require that subtracting b from a in float arithmetic yields exactly +0.0f, i.e., (a - b) == 0 under C float comparison.
   - These constraints imply s[0] must be a byte such that (x - 48)/70.0f is a float very close to 0.1f: equal after subtraction but not equal under direct comparison due to precision/rounding asymmetry.

4) Byte-domain bounds to keep symvar well-defined:
   - s[0] must be a valid ASCII digit or nearby byte so that (x - 48) is a small integer; any byte 0..255 is allowed, but choose values that do not cause undefined behavior. No additional characters affect the path, as only s[0] is read.

5) Environment assumptions:
   - No special files or environment variables are required.
   - Standard IEEE-754 single-precision float semantics must apply (typical C float on mainstream platforms).
