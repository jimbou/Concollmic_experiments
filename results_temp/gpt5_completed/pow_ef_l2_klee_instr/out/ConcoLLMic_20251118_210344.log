Justification: This is the core logic branch of the program and currently has 0% historical coverage (lines 14-15). Reaching the true side will exercise the logic bomb behavior that was completely untested in the current suite. It is reachable purely through the first command-line argument’s first byte, so it fits the existing harness model of a single string argument.

2025-11-18 21:04:46 | INFO | Path constraint generated: Chronological, external-input constraints to reach the target branch (true side of pow(s[0] - 48, 2) == 49):

1. Program invocation (command-line):
   - The program must be executed with at least one command-line argument beyond the executable name.
   - The first argument (argv[1]) must be a non-empty byte string.

2. Argument length requirement:
   - The argument must have length ≥ 1 because only the first byte is used in the branch condition.

3. First-byte numeric mapping:
   - Let b be the integer value of the first byte of argv[1] when interpreted as an unsigned 8-bit value (0–255).
   - The program computes symvar = b − 48. The branch requires pow(symvar, 2) == 49.

4. Mathematical constraint on the first byte:
   - pow(symvar, 2) == 49 implies symvar ∈ {7, −7}.
   - Therefore b − 48 ∈ {7, −7}.
   - Hence b ∈ {55, 41}.

5. Encoding/representation requirement:
   - Provide the first byte exactly as the value b above (no transformation). If using ASCII/UTF-8 text, ensure that the first character of the argument is the single-byte codepoint with value b.
   - Remaining bytes (if any) are unconstrained and can be arbitrary.

6. Environment/IO constraints:
   - No files or environment variables are required; only the process argument must satisfy the above properties.

These conditions ensure the program reaches logic_bomb and takes the true branch guarded by pow(s[0] - 48, 2) == 49.

EXPLORATION SUMMARY:

--- Branch 1 ---
TARGET BRANCH:
if (pow(s[0] - 48, 2) == 49) -> true in pow_ef_l2_klee.c:logic_bomb

JUSTIFICATION:
This is the core logic branch of the program and currently has 0% historical coverage (lines 14-15). Reaching the true side will exercise the logic bomb behavior that was completely untested in the current suite. It is reachable purely through the first command-line argument’s first byte, so it fits the existing harness model of a single string argument.

EXPECTED COVERED LINES:
pow_ef_l2_klee.c:14-15

PATH CONSTRAINT:
Chronological, external-input constraints to reach the target branch (true side of pow(s[0] - 48, 2) == 49):

1. Program invocation (command-line):
   - The program must be executed with at least one command-line argument beyond the executable name.
   - The first argument (argv[1]) must be a non-empty byte string.

2. Argument length requirement:
   - The argument must have length ≥ 1 because only the first byte is used in the branch condition.

3. First-byte numeric mapping:
   - Let b be the integer value of the first byte of argv[1] when interpreted as an unsigned 8-bit value (0–255).
   - The program computes symvar = b − 48. The branch requires pow(symvar, 2) == 49.

4. Mathematical constraint on the first byte:
   - pow(symvar, 2) == 49 implies symvar ∈ {7, −7}.
   - Therefore b − 48 ∈ {7, −7}.
   - Hence b ∈ {55, 41}.

5. Encoding/representation requirement:
   - Provide the first byte exactly as the value b above (no transformation). If using ASCII/UTF-8 text, ensure that the first character of the argument is the single-byte codepoint with value b.
   - Remaining bytes (if any) are unconstrained and can be arbitrary.

6. Environment/IO constraints:
   - No files or environment variables are required; only the process argument must satisfy the above properties.

These conditions ensure the program reaches logic_bomb and takes the true branch guarded by pow(s[0] - 48, 2) == 49.

2025-11-18 21:06:02 | INFO | Summarizer agent calling tool `generate_path_constraint`
2025-11-18 21:06:02 | INFO | Path constraint generated: Chronological input and environment constraints to reach main’s branch `if (argc < 2)` as true:

1. Command invocation style:
   - The executable must be launched in a way that provides fewer than two arguments to the C program’s `main(int argc, char** argv)`. In typical C conventions, `argc` counts the program name plus subsequent arguments. Therefore, to satisfy `argc < 2`, the program must be run without any user-supplied arguments (only the program name present).

2. Shell and executable path constraints (matching harness expectations):
   - Use the same executable binary path as the harness (e.g., `./temp_executable`).
   - Preserve the use of a shell if the harness requires it, but ensure no extra tokens are passed after the executable path, as any token would increase `argc`.

3. Environment constraints:
   - No environment variable expansion or shell word splitting should introduce extra arguments. For example, avoid constructs or glob patterns that would expand into additional tokens. The command line must contain only the executable path token.

4. I/O encoding constraints:
   - There is no input file or stdin dependency for this branch; no additional input should be provided that could be interpreted as command-line arguments.

5. Platform constraints:
   - Ensure the platform does not prepend default arguments automatically; standard POSIX behavior is expected where `argc` equals one when only the executable path is specified.

Satisfying the above ensures `argc` equals 1, making `argc < 2` true and executing the argument-handling branch lines (25-26).

2025-11-18 21:06:13 | DEBUG | Target branch selection and path constraint summary completed. Result: 

EXPLORATION SUMMARY:

--- Branch 1 ---
TARGET BRANCH:
if (argc < 2) -> true in pow_ef_l2_klee.c:main

JUSTIFICATION:
This branch has zero historical coverage (lines 25-26: 0/2, 0%). Exercising it will validate the program’s argument handling path and drive execution along a behavior distinct from the already-tested logic_bomb path. The currently executed run passes one user argument (“7”), so selecting the argc<2 branch ensures coverage of the input validation scenario where no user argument is provided.

EXPECTED COVERED LINES:
pow_ef_l2_klee.c:25-26

PATH CONSTRAINT:
Chronological input and environment constraints to reach main’s branch `if (argc < 2)` as true:

1. Command invocation style:
   - The executable must be launched in a way that provides fewer than two arguments to the C program’s `main(int argc, char** argv)`. In typical C conventions, `argc` counts the program name plus subsequent arguments. Therefore, to satisfy `argc < 2`, the program must be run without any user-supplied arguments (only the program name present).

2. Shell and executable path constraints (matching harness expectations):
   - Use the same executable binary path as the harness (e.g., `./temp_executable`).
   - Preserve the use of a shell if the harness requires it, but ensure no extra tokens are passed after the executable path, as any token would increase `argc`.

3. Environment constraints:
   - No environment variable expansion or shell word splitting should introduce extra arguments. For example, avoid constructs or glob patterns that would expand into additional tokens. The command line must contain only the executable path token.

4. I/O encoding constraints:
   - There is no input file or stdin dependency for this branch; no additional input should be provided that could be interpreted as command-line arguments.

5. Platform constraints:
   - Ensure the platform does not prepend default arguments automatically; standard POSIX behavior is expected where `argc` equals one when only the executable path is specified.

Satisfying the above ensures `argc` equals 1, making `argc < 2` true and executing the argument-handling branch lines (25-26).

Justification: This branch was not executed in the current trace because the harness invoked the program with no arguments (argc < 2). Although historical coverage is 100% for this file, there are no lower-coverage alternatives available. Reaching the true branch of this condition exercises the core behavioral divergence of the program (triggering the logic bomb) and will lead execution down a distinct path compared to the current run.

2025-11-18 21:08:05 | INFO | Path constraint generated: Chronological external-input and environment constraints to reach the target branch (pow(symvar, 2) == 49) -> true in logic_bomb:

1. Command invocation (argument count):
   - The program must be executed with exactly one user-supplied argument (in addition to the program name), so that argc >= 2 and the usage-exit path is bypassed.
   - Constraint: Provide a single input string as argv[1]. No additional arguments are necessary.

2. Input format for argv[1]:
   - argv[1] is treated as a C string. The program only reads its first byte and interprets it as an ASCII character.
   - Let b0 be the first byte of argv[1]. The program computes symvar = (int)b0 - 48.

3. Mathematical relation required to take the target branch:
   - The condition to trigger the branch is pow(symvar, 2) == 49.
   - Therefore, symvar must satisfy symvar^2 = 49, i.e., symvar ∈ {7, -7}.

4. Deriving the constraint on b0 (first byte of argv[1]) from symvar:
   - symvar = b0 - 48.
   - For symvar = 7: b0 = 55.
   - For symvar = -7: b0 = 41.

5. Final input constraint on argv[1]:
   - The first byte of argv[1] must be either decimal 55 or decimal 41.
   - The rest of argv[1] (subsequent bytes) are unconstrained and ignored by the program.

6. Environment assumptions:
   - No files or environment variables are used; standard math library availability is assumed. The program must be invokable on the target system with the provided single argument.

EXPLORATION SUMMARY:

--- Branch 1 ---
TARGET BRANCH:
if (pow(symvar, 2) == 49) -> true in pow_ef_l2_klee.c:logic_bomb

JUSTIFICATION:
This branch was not executed in the current trace because the harness invoked the program with no arguments (argc < 2). Although historical coverage is 100% for this file, there are no lower-coverage alternatives available. Reaching the true branch of this condition exercises the core behavioral divergence of the program (triggering the logic bomb) and will lead execution down a distinct path compared to the current run.

EXPECTED COVERED LINES:
pow_ef_l2_klee.c:14-15

PATH CONSTRAINT:
Chronological external-input and environment constraints to reach the target branch (pow(symvar, 2) == 49) -> true in logic_bomb:

1. Command invocation (argument count):
   - The program must be executed with exactly one user-supplied argument (in addition to the program name), so that argc >= 2 and the usage-exit path is bypassed.
   - Constraint: Provide a single input string as argv[1]. No additional arguments are necessary.

2. Input format for argv[1]:
   - argv[1] is treated as a C string. The program only reads its first byte and interprets it as an ASCII character.
   - Let b0 be the first byte of argv[1]. The program computes symvar = (int)b0 - 48.

3. Mathematical relation required to take the target branch:
   - The condition to trigger the branch is pow(symvar, 2) == 49.
   - Therefore, symvar must satisfy symvar^2 = 49, i.e., symvar ∈ {7, -7}.

4. Deriving the constraint on b0 (first byte of argv[1]) from symvar:
   - symvar = b0 - 48.
   - For symvar = 7: b0 = 55.
   - For symvar = -7: b0 = 41.

5. Final input constraint on argv[1]:
   - The first byte of argv[1] must be either decimal 55 or decimal 41.
   - The rest of argv[1] (subsequent bytes) are unconstrained and ignored by the program.

6. Environment assumptions:
   - No files or environment variables are used; standard math library availability is assumed. The program must be invokable on the target system with the provided single argument.
