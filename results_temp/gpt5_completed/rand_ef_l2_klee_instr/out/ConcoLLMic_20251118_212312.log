2025-11-18 21:24:09 | INFO | Target branch selected: if (r == 77) -> true in rand_ef_l2_klee.c:logic_bomb
Justification: This branch has zero historical coverage (0/2, 0%) and represents the primary divergent behavior (“bomb” path) guarded by a pseudo-random check. Reaching it will exercise previously unseen code and improve coverage in this file. The existing harness already supplies a single 4-byte string argument, so focusing on the RNG-dependent condition is the most impactful uncovered branch reachable via input/environment manipulation.

2025-11-18 21:25:08 | INFO | Path constraint generated: Chronological, input-level constraints to reach the branch where rand()%100 == 77 after srand(s[0]):

1. Command-line invocation shape:
   - The program must be executed with exactly one user-controlled string argument (argv[1]) in addition to the program name, so total argc ≥ 2.
   - The argument must be a string of length exactly 4 bytes, as expected by the harness and annotations (no embedded NUL within the first 4 bytes). Encoding can be arbitrary 8-bit bytes.

2. Environment and system assumptions:
   - The C runtime’s rand() and srand() functions must behave deterministically per the standard C library implementation used, with srand(seed) setting the PRNG state solely based on the provided seed byte value s[0]. No other calls to rand() occur before the targeted call.
   - No environment variables or earlier code alter the PRNG state; the only seed-setting call is srand(s[0]) inside logic_bomb.

3. Seeding constraint linking argument to PRNG state:
   - Let seed = the integer value of the first byte of the argument (argv[1][0]) interpreted as unsigned char promoted to int in C.
   - The PRNG is seeded by srand(seed). Immediately after, the program calls rand() once and computes r = rand() % 100.

4. Target numeric relation:
   - Require (rand_after_seed(seed) mod 100) == 77, where rand_after_seed(seed) denotes the first value returned by rand() after seeding with srand(seed) in the runtime’s libc.

5. Input constraint binding:
   - Choose the first byte of argv[1] such that it is a seed value seed satisfying the relation in (4). The remaining three bytes of argv[1] are unconstrained aside from being valid non-NUL bytes to maintain a 4-byte length if the program relies on C-string semantics; they do not influence the branch.

6. Robustness for C-string termination:
   - Ensure argv[1] contains no NUL (0x00) in the first position; otherwise, the effective seed would be 0. Also ensure the argument is not shorter than 1 byte; the harness provides 4 bytes so this is satisfied. If the program reads until NUL, embedded NULs after the first byte are acceptable for seeding but may truncate the visible argument; they do not affect the PRNG state.

This specification intentionally leaves the exact mapping from seed to rand() output abstract; the solver or test-generation system must select a seed such that the first rand() value modulo 100 equals 77 under the target libc’s PRNG.

EXPLORATION SUMMARY:

--- Branch 1 ---
TARGET BRANCH:
if (r == 77) -> true in rand_ef_l2_klee.c:logic_bomb

JUSTIFICATION:
This branch has zero historical coverage (0/2, 0%) and represents the primary divergent behavior (“bomb” path) guarded by a pseudo-random check. Reaching it will exercise previously unseen code and improve coverage in this file. The existing harness already supplies a single 4-byte string argument, so focusing on the RNG-dependent condition is the most impactful uncovered branch reachable via input/environment manipulation.

EXPECTED COVERED LINES:
rand_ef_l2_klee.c:16-17

PATH CONSTRAINT:
Chronological, input-level constraints to reach the branch where rand()%100 == 77 after srand(s[0]):

1. Command-line invocation shape:
   - The program must be executed with exactly one user-controlled string argument (argv[1]) in addition to the program name, so total argc ≥ 2.
   - The argument must be a string of length exactly 4 bytes, as expected by the harness and annotations (no embedded NUL within the first 4 bytes). Encoding can be arbitrary 8-bit bytes.

2. Environment and system assumptions:
   - The C runtime’s rand() and srand() functions must behave deterministically per the standard C library implementation used, with srand(seed) setting the PRNG state solely based on the provided seed byte value s[0]. No other calls to rand() occur before the targeted call.
   - No environment variables or earlier code alter the PRNG state; the only seed-setting call is srand(s[0]) inside logic_bomb.

3. Seeding constraint linking argument to PRNG state:
   - Let seed = the integer value of the first byte of the argument (argv[1][0]) interpreted as unsigned char promoted to int in C.
   - The PRNG is seeded by srand(seed). Immediately after, the program calls rand() once and computes r = rand() % 100.

4. Target numeric relation:
   - Require (rand_after_seed(seed) mod 100) == 77, where rand_after_seed(seed) denotes the first value returned by rand() after seeding with srand(seed) in the runtime’s libc.

5. Input constraint binding:
   - Choose the first byte of argv[1] such that it is a seed value seed satisfying the relation in (4). The remaining three bytes of argv[1] are unconstrained aside from being valid non-NUL bytes to maintain a 4-byte length if the program relies on C-string semantics; they do not influence the branch.

6. Robustness for C-string termination:
   - Ensure argv[1] contains no NUL (0x00) in the first position; otherwise, the effective seed would be 0. Also ensure the argument is not shorter than 1 byte; the harness provides 4 bytes so this is satisfied. If the program reads until NUL, embedded NULs after the first byte are acceptable for seeding but may truncate the visible argument; they do not affect the PRNG state.

This specification intentionally leaves the exact mapping from seed to rand() output abstract; the solver or test-generation system must select a seed such that the first rand() value modulo 100 equals 77 under the target libc’s PRNG.
