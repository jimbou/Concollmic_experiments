justification: |-
  This branch represents the path where the logic bomb is not triggered. Currently, this branch has 0% coverage (lines 13-14 are marked as not covered). This is a high-priority branch because:

  1. It represents a critical alternative path in the program's core functionality
  2. It has zero historical coverage (0/2 lines)
  3. It contains the code that executes when the logic bomb condition is not met, which is essential for complete testing of this security-related program
  4. Exploring this branch will help us understand the intended non-malicious behavior of the program

  The current execution with input "AAAA" doesn't take this path because 'A' (ASCII 65) minus 48 equals 17, which causes an out-of-bounds array access that likely triggers the logic bomb condition.
target_path_constraint: |-
  To reach the branch where `if (a[symvar]<0 || a[symvar] > 6)` evaluates to false in the logic_bomb function, we need to ensure:

  1. Program must be executed with at least one command-line argument (argc >= 2)
     - The first argument (argv[1]) must be a string with at least one character

  2. The first character of the input string (s[0]) must satisfy the following constraints:
     - Let symvar = s[0] - 48
     - symvar must be an index that is within the bounds of array a[] (which has 6 elements)
     - symvar must be in the range [0, 5] (inclusive)
     - This means s[0] must be in the range [48, 53] (inclusive)
     - In ASCII, this corresponds to the characters '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', or '5'

  3. Additionally, the value at a[symvar] must NOT be less than 0 AND must NOT be greater than 6
     - Since array a is initialized as {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, all values are between 1 and 6
     - Therefore, any valid index within bounds will automatically satisfy this condition

  In summary, the constraint is simply:
  - The first character of the command-line argument must be one of: '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', or '5'
  - The rest of the string can be any characters (they are not used by the program)
