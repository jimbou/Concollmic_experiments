Justification: This is the core branch guarding the “bomb” behavior and has zero historical coverage (Unexecuted code (lines 16-17) removed. Its line cov: 0/2 (0%)). Reaching it exercises a path different from the current run, which only took the else-branch that prints to stderr. Triggering this branch will directly increase coverage and validate the program’s key logic dependent on the first command-line argument.

2025-11-18 21:10:14 | INFO | Path constraint generated: Chronological, external-input constraints to reach the branch `if (x - 197 == 0)` -> true in logic_bomb:

1. Program invocation constraints:
   - The program must be executed with exactly one positional argument beyond the executable name, ensuring `argc >= 2` so that `argv[1]` exists.
   - The test harness already passes a single string argument; do not alter the number of arguments, only its content.

2. Argument format constraints (on argv[1]):
   - argv[1] must be a byte string encoded in UTF-8 (the harness uses `encoding="utf-8"` with replacement for invalid bytes). Keep bytes valid UTF-8 to avoid replacement artifacts.
   - Length requirement: The argument string must have length at least 1 since only the first character is read.

3. Semantic value constraint of the first character:
   - Let c be the first character of argv[1]. The program computes `symvar = (ASCII_code_of_c) - 48` and then `x = symvar + 190` and checks `x - 197 == 0`.
   - Therefore, require: (ASCII_code_of_c) - 48 + 190 - 197 == 0.
   - Simplify: ASCII_code_of_c - 55 == 0 -> ASCII_code_of_c == 55.
   - Constraint: The first character of argv[1] must be the ASCII character with code 55 (the character '7').

4. Remaining characters:
   - Any remaining characters after the first may be arbitrary valid UTF-8, as they are ignored by the program.

5. Environment constraints:
   - No files or environment variables are used; ensure the executable is callable and has normal permissions. No special locale or floating-point settings are required.

These constraints guarantee `x == 197` holds, causing the target branch body to execute.

EXPLORATION SUMMARY:

--- Branch 1 ---
TARGET BRANCH:
if (x - 197 == 0) -> true in printfloat_ef_l1_klee.c:logic_bomb

JUSTIFICATION:
This is the core branch guarding the “bomb” behavior and has zero historical coverage (Unexecuted code (lines 16-17) removed. Its line cov: 0/2 (0%)). Reaching it exercises a path different from the current run, which only took the else-branch that prints to stderr. Triggering this branch will directly increase coverage and validate the program’s key logic dependent on the first command-line argument.

EXPECTED COVERED LINES:
printfloat_ef_l1_klee.c:16-17

PATH CONSTRAINT:
Chronological, external-input constraints to reach the branch `if (x - 197 == 0)` -> true in logic_bomb:

1. Program invocation constraints:
   - The program must be executed with exactly one positional argument beyond the executable name, ensuring `argc >= 2` so that `argv[1]` exists.
   - The test harness already passes a single string argument; do not alter the number of arguments, only its content.

2. Argument format constraints (on argv[1]):
   - argv[1] must be a byte string encoded in UTF-8 (the harness uses `encoding="utf-8"` with replacement for invalid bytes). Keep bytes valid UTF-8 to avoid replacement artifacts.
   - Length requirement: The argument string must have length at least 1 since only the first character is read.

3. Semantic value constraint of the first character:
   - Let c be the first character of argv[1]. The program computes `symvar = (ASCII_code_of_c) - 48` and then `x = symvar + 190` and checks `x - 197 == 0`.
   - Therefore, require: (ASCII_code_of_c) - 48 + 190 - 197 == 0.
   - Simplify: ASCII_code_of_c - 55 == 0 -> ASCII_code_of_c == 55.
   - Constraint: The first character of argv[1] must be the ASCII character with code 55 (the character '7').

4. Remaining characters:
   - Any remaining characters after the first may be arbitrary valid UTF-8, as they are ignored by the program.

5. Environment constraints:
   - No files or environment variables are used; ensure the executable is callable and has normal permissions. No special locale or floating-point settings are required.

These constraints guarantee `x == 197` holds, causing the target branch body to execute.

2025-11-18 21:11:37 | INFO | Target branch selected: if (argc < 2) -> true in printfloat_ef_l1_klee.c:main
Justification: This branch has zero historical coverage (line cov: 0/2 (0%)) and was not executed in the current trace. Exercising it explores the program’s argument validation path, which is distinct from the already-covered logic path in logic_bomb and directly improves coverage with previously untested behavior. It is reachable via the harness by manipulating command-line arguments (invoking the binary without any positional arguments).

2025-11-18 21:12:06 | INFO | Path constraint generated: 1. Process invocation constraint: The program must be executed without providing any positional command-line arguments beyond the program name itself. Formally, the argument count (argc) observed by main must be 1.
   - If a shell is used to launch the program, ensure the command line does not include a space-separated second token that the program would parse as argv[1]. For example, invoke the binary directly without trailing tokens or quoted strings that would become additional argv entries.
   - Environment variables may be set arbitrarily; they do not affect argc.

2. Input handling constraint: Since main reads argv[1] only when argc >= 2, to reach the target branch (argc < 2), avoid any mechanisms that would supply argv[1] indirectly (such as wrappers that append implicit arguments). The executable must be the sole token passed to execve/execvp.

3. I/O constraints: No input files or stdin content are required to reach the branch; the decision depends solely on the command-line argument count.

Resulting path condition: argc == 1 at program entry, which makes the condition (argc < 2) evaluate to true, entering the branch body.

2025-11-18 21:12:16 | DEBUG | Target branch selection and path constraint summary completed. Result: 

EXPLORATION SUMMARY:

--- Branch 1 ---
TARGET BRANCH:
if (argc < 2) -> true in printfloat_ef_l1_klee.c:main

JUSTIFICATION:
This branch has zero historical coverage (line cov: 0/2 (0%)) and was not executed in the current trace. Exercising it explores the program’s argument validation path, which is distinct from the already-covered logic path in logic_bomb and directly improves coverage with previously untested behavior. It is reachable via the harness by manipulating command-line arguments (invoking the binary without any positional arguments).

EXPECTED COVERED LINES:
printfloat_ef_l1_klee.c:26-27

PATH CONSTRAINT:
1. Process invocation constraint: The program must be executed without providing any positional command-line arguments beyond the program name itself. Formally, the argument count (argc) observed by main must be 1.
   - If a shell is used to launch the program, ensure the command line does not include a space-separated second token that the program would parse as argv[1]. For example, invoke the binary directly without trailing tokens or quoted strings that would become additional argv entries.
   - Environment variables may be set arbitrarily; they do not affect argc.

2. Input handling constraint: Since main reads argv[1] only when argc >= 2, to reach the target branch (argc < 2), avoid any mechanisms that would supply argv[1] indirectly (such as wrappers that append implicit arguments). The executable must be the sole token passed to execve/execvp.

3. I/O constraints: No input files or stdin content are required to reach the branch; the decision depends solely on the command-line argument count.

Resulting path condition: argc == 1 at program entry, which makes the condition (argc < 2) evaluate to true, entering the branch body.

Justification: This is the only conditional branch in the executed file that was not taken in the current run and leads to a different program behavior (the "bomb" path). While historical coverage shows 100%, exercising this branch in the current harness will diversify the execution path and validate the arithmetic and input-handling logic tied to the first command-line argument. There are no other uncovered or low-coverage branches visible in this trace, so this branch is the most impactful available target.

2025-11-18 21:13:33 | INFO | Path constraint generated: Chronological, self-contained constraints to reach the branch where (x - 197 == 0) evaluates to true in logic_bomb:

1. Process invocation:
   - The program must be executed with exactly one additional command-line argument beyond the program name (i.e., two argv entries total). The harness already supplies one argument string, and this must remain present.

2. Argument encoding and length:
   - The command-line argument must be a byte string encoded in UTF-8 (ASCII-compatible). Its length must be at least 1 byte so that the first character exists.

3. First character numeric constraint (drives arithmetic to the target):
   - Let s[0] denote the first byte of the argument string.
   - Interpret s[0] as its ASCII code. Define symvar = s[0] - 48 (where 48 is the ASCII code for character '0').
   - Define x = symvar + 190 (a floating-point value).
   - To satisfy the branch condition x - 197 == 0, enforce symvar = 7, which implies s[0] must be the ASCII character whose code equals 55 ('7').

4. Remaining characters unconstrained:
   - All subsequent bytes in the argument may be arbitrary; they do not affect the targeted branch.

5. Environment and I/O:
   - No files or environment variables are required. Standard output and error may be produced but do not affect path feasibility.

EXPLORATION SUMMARY:

--- Branch 1 ---
TARGET BRANCH:
if (x - 197 == 0) -> true in printfloat_ef_l1_klee.c:logic_bomb

JUSTIFICATION:
This is the only conditional branch in the executed file that was not taken in the current run and leads to a different program behavior (the "bomb" path). While historical coverage shows 100%, exercising this branch in the current harness will diversify the execution path and validate the arithmetic and input-handling logic tied to the first command-line argument. There are no other uncovered or low-coverage branches visible in this trace, so this branch is the most impactful available target.

EXPECTED COVERED LINES:
printfloat_ef_l1_klee.c:16-17

PATH CONSTRAINT:
Chronological, self-contained constraints to reach the branch where (x - 197 == 0) evaluates to true in logic_bomb:

1. Process invocation:
   - The program must be executed with exactly one additional command-line argument beyond the program name (i.e., two argv entries total). The harness already supplies one argument string, and this must remain present.

2. Argument encoding and length:
   - The command-line argument must be a byte string encoded in UTF-8 (ASCII-compatible). Its length must be at least 1 byte so that the first character exists.

3. First character numeric constraint (drives arithmetic to the target):
   - Let s[0] denote the first byte of the argument string.
   - Interpret s[0] as its ASCII code. Define symvar = s[0] - 48 (where 48 is the ASCII code for character '0').
   - Define x = symvar + 190 (a floating-point value).
   - To satisfy the branch condition x - 197 == 0, enforce symvar = 7, which implies s[0] must be the ASCII character whose code equals 55 ('7').

4. Remaining characters unconstrained:
   - All subsequent bytes in the argument may be arbitrary; they do not affect the targeted branch.

5. Environment and I/O:
   - No files or environment variables are required. Standard output and error may be produced but do not affect path feasibility.

2025-11-18 21:16:07 | INFO | Target branch selected: if (x - 197 == 0) -> true in printfloat_ef_l1_klee.c:logic_bomb
Justification: This branch was not executed in the current trace because the program exited early when no input argument was provided (argc == 1). Although historical coverage shows 100%, reaching this branch in our current exploration is valuable because it exercises the core logic of the program (logic_bomb) and drives a distinct behavior path (emitting "Logic bomb triggered" and returning 1). It will also necessarily traverse the previously unexecuted path in main (argc >= 2) to call logic_bomb, thereby improving coverage for this execution.

2025-11-18 21:16:45 | INFO | Path constraint generated: Chronological, self-contained constraints to reach: if (x - 197 == 0) -> true in logic_bomb

1. Command invocation constraints:
- The program must be executed with at least one positional argument (argc >= 2 as seen by the C program). In practice, the first argument after the program name must exist and be a string.

2. Input string format constraints (semantics of the program’s expected input):
- The program reads the first command-line argument as a C string s.
- The logic uses only s[0] (the first byte/character of this string).
- s must have length >= 1 (i.e., contain at least one byte before the null terminator) so that s[0] is defined.

3. Mathematical relation to trigger the target branch:
- The program computes symvar = (ASCII_code_of_s[0]) - 48.
- Then computes x = symvar + 190.
- The target branch condition is (x - 197 == 0), i.e., x == 197.
- Therefore, symvar must equal 7.
- Therefore, ASCII_code_of_s[0] must equal 55 (since 7 + 48 = 55).

4. Encoding and environment constraints:
- s[0] must be the character whose ASCII code is 55 (decimal). Ensure the program’s argument parsing uses standard ASCII/UTF-8 such that this byte value is preserved.
- No additional file I/O or environment variables are required; only the command-line argument matters.

5. Summary of concrete symbolic constraint on input argument:
- Provide exactly one non-empty string argument after the program name.
- Its first byte must be ASCII decimal 55. Subsequent bytes, if any, are unconstrained.

EXPLORATION SUMMARY:

--- Branch 1 ---
TARGET BRANCH:
if (x - 197 == 0) -> true in printfloat_ef_l1_klee.c:logic_bomb

JUSTIFICATION:
This branch was not executed in the current trace because the program exited early when no input argument was provided (argc == 1). Although historical coverage shows 100%, reaching this branch in our current exploration is valuable because it exercises the core logic of the program (logic_bomb) and drives a distinct behavior path (emitting "Logic bomb triggered" and returning 1). It will also necessarily traverse the previously unexecuted path in main (argc >= 2) to call logic_bomb, thereby improving coverage for this execution.

EXPECTED COVERED LINES:
printfloat_ef_l1_klee.c:16-17

PATH CONSTRAINT:
Chronological, self-contained constraints to reach: if (x - 197 == 0) -> true in logic_bomb

1. Command invocation constraints:
- The program must be executed with at least one positional argument (argc >= 2 as seen by the C program). In practice, the first argument after the program name must exist and be a string.

2. Input string format constraints (semantics of the program’s expected input):
- The program reads the first command-line argument as a C string s.
- The logic uses only s[0] (the first byte/character of this string).
- s must have length >= 1 (i.e., contain at least one byte before the null terminator) so that s[0] is defined.

3. Mathematical relation to trigger the target branch:
- The program computes symvar = (ASCII_code_of_s[0]) - 48.
- Then computes x = symvar + 190.
- The target branch condition is (x - 197 == 0), i.e., x == 197.
- Therefore, symvar must equal 7.
- Therefore, ASCII_code_of_s[0] must equal 55 (since 7 + 48 = 55).

4. Encoding and environment constraints:
- s[0] must be the character whose ASCII code is 55 (decimal). Ensure the program’s argument parsing uses standard ASCII/UTF-8 such that this byte value is preserved.
- No additional file I/O or environment variables are required; only the command-line argument matters.

5. Summary of concrete symbolic constraint on input argument:
- Provide exactly one non-empty string argument after the program name.
- Its first byte must be ASCII decimal 55. Subsequent bytes, if any, are unconstrained.
