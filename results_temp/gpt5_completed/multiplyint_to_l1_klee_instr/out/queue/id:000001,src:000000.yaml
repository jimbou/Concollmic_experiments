justification: 'This is the core “bomb-triggering” branch and currently has zero historical
  coverage (lines 8-9: 0/2, 0%). Reaching it exercises arithmetic overflow/edge behavior
  and diverges from the executed path, which only hit the else branch printing “Path
  without the bomb.” Given the harness supplies a single string argument, guiding
  the first byte so that the multiplication under 32-bit signed wraparound becomes
  negative while the derived integer is positive will cover previously unseen behavior.'
target_path_constraint: |-
  Environment and invocation constraints (chronological):

  1) Program invocation via harness:
  - The harness will execute the binary as a shell command string: "./temp_executable AAAA".
  - Therefore, the process receives argc == 2 and argv[1] is the ASCII string passed by the harness.
  - No changes to the executable path or arg count are permitted by the harness.

  2) Argument presence/format constraints (to reach logic_bomb):
  - A single command-line argument must be present (sourced from the harness); main enforces argc >= 2 before passing argv[1] to logic_bomb.
  - The argument is treated as a byte string s. The function uses only s[0].

  3) Character-to-integer mapping used by the program:
  - The program computes symvar = s[0] - 48, where 48 is the ASCII code of character '0'.
  - Thus, symvar is the integer value of the first byte minus 48. For example, if s[0] is the ASCII digit '0'..'9', then symvar is 0..9. Non-digit bytes yield other integers (can be negative or >9).

  4) Target branch boolean condition to satisfy (two conjuncts):
  - Conjunct A (positivity): symvar > 0. This requires s[0] be a byte value strictly greater than 48 (ASCII '0').
  - Conjunct B (signed-32-bit overflow-induced negativity): (254,748,364 * symvar) < 0 when the multiplication is performed in 32-bit signed arithmetic with wraparound on overflow. This must be interpreted in two’s-complement 32-bit semantics as used by typical C int on the target build, so the product is truncated to 32 bits and then compared as signed.

  5) Formalized constraint under 32-bit signed wraparound semantics:
  - Let symvar = (unsigned char)s[0] - 48, interpreted as an int in C after usual integer promotions.
  - Require: symvar ∈ Z, symvar > 0.
  - Let P = ( (254748364 * symvar) modulo 2^32 ). Interpret P as a signed 32-bit integer in range [-2^31, 2^31 - 1] via two’s complement.
  - Require: P < 0.

  6) Constraints on the remainder of the string:
  - The remaining bytes s[1], s[2], s[3], if present, are ignored by the branch condition and may be arbitrary; there are no NUL-termination requirements stated in the code, but typical argv strings are NUL-terminated. No other bytes influence the branch.

  7) Encoding and byte-level specification for the first byte:
  - Let b0 be the first byte value of argv[1] (0..255). Then symvar = b0 - 48 using integer arithmetic on promoted b0.
  - Final combined constraint: b0 ∈ {49..255} such that when computing P = ((254,748,364 * (b0 - 48)) mod 2^32) and interpreting P as signed 32-bit, P is negative.

  Notes:
  - Do not assume defined behavior beyond 32-bit two’s-complement wraparound for int; this is the intended interpretation to make the guarded condition satisfiable while keeping symvar > 0.
  - No file I/O or environment variables participate; only argv[1][0] matters.
