Justification: This is the core, currently never-covered (0%) “bomb” path of the program. The execution trace shows only the else branch executing, printing "Path without the bomb". The true branch is protected by a compound condition and has historical coverage 0/2 (0%), making it a high-priority target for increasing coverage and exercising distinct program behavior. Reaching it will definitively execute new code not seen by the current tests.

2025-11-17 20:51:17 | INFO | Path constraint generated: Chronological, self-contained constraints to reach the target branch (the "bomb" path):

1) Process invocation format
- The program is invoked as a native executable with exactly one required user-supplied string argument after the program name. The harness already ensures one argument is passed.
- The argument is treated as a C string (bytes) and must have length at least 1 byte so that the first character can be read.

2) Argument content model
- Let s be the single string argument. The decision logic depends only on s[0], the first byte of s.
- Define symvar = (unsigned char)s[0] interpreted as an 8-bit value, then converted to a signed int via "s[0] - 48" (where 48 is ASCII '0'). The intended semantics in the code are: symvar = (int)(s[0]) - 48.

3) Compound branch condition requirements
To take the target branch, BOTH of the following must hold:
- Condition A: symvar + 2147483640 < 0
- Condition B: symvar > 0

4) Derived numeric constraints on s[0]
Given symvar = (int)(s[0]) - 48:
- From Condition B: (int)(s[0]) - 48 > 0  =>  (int)(s[0]) > 48.
- From Condition A: (int)(s[0]) - 48 + 2147483640 < 0  =>  (int)(s[0]) < 48 - 2147483640.

5) Encoding/representation details
- s[0] is a single byte in the string argument; no specific encoding is required beyond being passed through the OS argument vector. Non-ASCII bytes are allowed; they are treated numerically by the C implementation.
- There are no additional file I/O, environment variables, or secondary inputs influencing the branch; only the first byte of the argument matters.

6) Summary (SMT-style):
Let b be an 8-bit value for the first byte of the argument.
- symvar = (Int(b)) - 48
- (symvar + 2147483640) < 0
- symvar > 0
Where Int(b) is the integer lift of the byte value b ∈ [0,255].

EXPLORATION SUMMARY:

--- Branch 1 ---
TARGET BRANCH:
if (symvar + 2147483640 < 0 && symvar > 0) -> true in addint_to_l1_klee.c:logic_bomb

JUSTIFICATION:
This is the core, currently never-covered (0%) “bomb” path of the program. The execution trace shows only the else branch executing, printing "Path without the bomb". The true branch is protected by a compound condition and has historical coverage 0/2 (0%), making it a high-priority target for increasing coverage and exercising distinct program behavior. Reaching it will definitively execute new code not seen by the current tests.

EXPECTED COVERED LINES:
addint_to_l1_klee.c:9-10

PATH CONSTRAINT:
Chronological, self-contained constraints to reach the target branch (the "bomb" path):

1) Process invocation format
- The program is invoked as a native executable with exactly one required user-supplied string argument after the program name. The harness already ensures one argument is passed.
- The argument is treated as a C string (bytes) and must have length at least 1 byte so that the first character can be read.

2) Argument content model
- Let s be the single string argument. The decision logic depends only on s[0], the first byte of s.
- Define symvar = (unsigned char)s[0] interpreted as an 8-bit value, then converted to a signed int via "s[0] - 48" (where 48 is ASCII '0'). The intended semantics in the code are: symvar = (int)(s[0]) - 48.

3) Compound branch condition requirements
To take the target branch, BOTH of the following must hold:
- Condition A: symvar + 2147483640 < 0
- Condition B: symvar > 0

4) Derived numeric constraints on s[0]
Given symvar = (int)(s[0]) - 48:
- From Condition B: (int)(s[0]) - 48 > 0  =>  (int)(s[0]) > 48.
- From Condition A: (int)(s[0]) - 48 + 2147483640 < 0  =>  (int)(s[0]) < 48 - 2147483640.

5) Encoding/representation details
- s[0] is a single byte in the string argument; no specific encoding is required beyond being passed through the OS argument vector. Non-ASCII bytes are allowed; they are treated numerically by the C implementation.
- There are no additional file I/O, environment variables, or secondary inputs influencing the branch; only the first byte of the argument matters.

6) Summary (SMT-style):
Let b be an 8-bit value for the first byte of the argument.
- symvar = (Int(b)) - 48
- (symvar + 2147483640) < 0
- symvar > 0
Where Int(b) is the integer lift of the byte value b ∈ [0,255].
