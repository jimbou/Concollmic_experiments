2025-11-14 22:18:46 | INFO | Summarizer agent calling tool `think`
2025-11-14 22:18:46 | INFO | Thinking process: Let me analyze the program `float5_fp_l2_klee.c`:

1. The program takes a command line argument and passes it to the `logic_bomb` function.
2. In `logic_bomb`, the string argument is converted to a float using `atof()`, then several floating-point operations are performed.
3. There are two conditional branches that weren't executed in the current trace:
   - `if (x > 0.1)` - This has 0% line coverage
   - `if(x == 8)` - This has 0% line coverage

The current execution:
- The program was run with the argument "AAAA"
- This would convert to 0.0 with atof() since "AAAA" isn't a valid number
- Then x = 0.0/10.0 + 0.1 = 0.1
- Then x = 0.1 * 0.1 = 0.01
- So x is 0.01, which is:
  - NOT > 0.1 (first branch not taken)
  - NOT == 0.02 (second branch condition is true, so this branch is taken)
  - After x = x + 7.98 = 0.01 + 7.98 = 7.99
  - NOT == 8 (third branch not taken)

For target branches, I should prioritize:
1. `if (x > 0.1)` -> true - This requires finding an input that makes x > 0.1 after the operations
2. `if(x == 8)` -> true - This requires finding an input that makes x exactly 8 after the operations

Let me think about the constraints needed for each branch.

2025-11-14 22:19:11 | INFO | Summarizer agent response: 
Let me analyze the code more deeply to understand the floating-point operations and constraints needed to reach the uncovered branches.
2025-11-14 22:19:11 | INFO | Summarizer agent calling tool `think`
2025-11-14 22:19:11 | INFO | Thinking process: Let's analyze the path constraints for each target branch:

1. For `if (x > 0.1)` -> true:
   - We start with x = atof(symvar)
   - Then x = x/10.0
   - Then x = x + 0.1
   - Then x = x * x
   - We need x > 0.1 at this point

   Working backwards:
   - We need x * x > 0.1
   - So x > sqrt(0.1) ≈ 0.316
   - This means x + 0.1 > 0.316
   - So x/10.0 + 0.1 > 0.316
   - x/10.0 > 0.216
   - x > 2.16

   So we need atof(symvar) > 2.16 to satisfy this branch.

2. For `if(x == 8)` -> true:
   - This is more complex because we need to consider the previous conditions
   - We need x to be exactly 8 after x = x + 7.98
   - So before this addition, we need x = 0.02
   - This means we need x * x = 0.02 after the squaring operation
   - So x = sqrt(0.02) ≈ 0.141 before squaring
   - This means x + 0.1 = 0.141
   - So x/10.0 = 0.041
   - x = 0.41

   So we need atof(symvar) = 0.41 to reach the second target branch.

Let me double-check these calculations:

For symvar = "0.41":
- x = 0.41
- x = x/10.0 = 0.041
- x = x + 0.1 = 0.141
- x = x * x = 0.0199 (approximately 0.02 with floating-point precision)
- if (x > 0.1) -> false (0.0199 is not > 0.1)
- if (x != 0.02) -> false (0.0199 is approximately 0.02)
- We don't enter the block where x = x + 7.98, so we don't reach the third branch

Wait, there's an issue with my analysis. Let me reconsider the second target branch.

For the `if(x == 8)` branch to be true:
- We need to first enter the `if(x != 0.02)` block (so x must not be 0.02)
- Then x = x + 7.98
- Then we need x == 8

So we need x = 0.02 before the addition, which means:
- x * x = 0.02
- x = sqrt(0.02) ≈ 0.141
- x + 0.1 = 0.141
- x/10.0 = 0.041
- x = 0.41

But this would make x == 0.02 (approximately), which means we wouldn't enter the block with x = x + 7.98.

I need to rethink this. For the `if(x == 8)` branch:
- We need to first pass through `if(x != 0.02)` (so x must not be 0.02)
- Then x = x + 7.98
- Then x == 8

So we need x + 7.98 = 8, which means x = 0.02 before the addition.
But this contradicts the requirement that x != 0.02 to enter this block.

Let me verify the code again... I see the issue. The code structure is:

```c
if(x != 0.02) {
    x = x + 7.98;
    if(x == 8) {
        // Target branch
    }
}
```

So we need:
1. x != 0.02 (to enter the first if)
2. After x = x + 7.98, we need x == 8

This means before the addition, we need x = 0.02 (to make x == 8 after adding 7.98).
But this contradicts condition 1 (x != 0.02).

Due to floating-point precision, there might be a value very close to 0.02 but not exactly 0.02 that could work. Let's try to find such a value.

If we want x to be very close to 0.02 but not exactly 0.02 due to floating-point representation:
- We need a value that when added to 7.98 gives exactly 8
- This would be a value extremely close to 0.02

Let me try a different approach. Maybe we need an input that makes x exactly 0.02 in the floating-point representation after the operations, but due to floating-point precision issues, it's not recognized as exactly 0.02 in the comparison.

Let's focus on the first target branch for now: `if (x > 0.1)` -> true
We need atof(symvar) > 2.16 to satisfy this branch.

Justification: This branch has 0% historical coverage as indicated by the line coverage information. It represents a critical path in the program's logic that hasn't been explored yet. The current execution with input "AAAA" converts to 0.0 via atof(), which after the operations (divide by 10, add 0.1, then square) results in x = 0.01, which is not greater than 0.1. Exploring this branch would significantly improve code coverage and help understand the program's behavior when provided with numeric inputs that satisfy this condition.

2025-11-14 22:19:50 | INFO | Path constraint generated: To reach the branch `if (x > 0.1) -> true` in the logic_bomb function, we need to satisfy the following constraint:

1. The program takes a command-line string argument that is converted to a float using atof().
2. This float value undergoes the following transformations:
   - Divided by 10.0
   - 0.1 is added to the result
   - The resulting value is squared (multiplied by itself)
3. After these operations, the value must be greater than 0.1

Expressing this mathematically:
Let s = the command-line string argument
Let x = atof(s)

We need:
(((x / 10.0) + 0.1) * ((x / 10.0) + 0.1)) > 0.1

Simplifying:
((x / 10.0) + 0.1)² > 0.1
(x/10.0)² + 2*(x/10.0)*0.1 + 0.01 > 0.1
(x/10.0)² + (x/5.0)*0.1 + 0.01 > 0.1
(x/10.0)² + (x/50.0) + 0.01 > 0.1
(x/10.0)² + (x/50.0) > 0.09

Therefore, the command-line argument must be a string that represents a number such that when parsed by atof(), the resulting float value x satisfies:
(x/10.0)² + (x/50.0) > 0.09

A value of x > 2.16 would satisfy this constraint. The command-line argument should be a string representation of a number greater than 2.16, such as "3", "10", "2.17", etc.

EXPLORATION SUMMARY:

--- Branch 1 ---
TARGET BRANCH:
if (x > 0.1) -> true in float5_fp_l2_klee.c:logic_bomb

JUSTIFICATION:
This branch has 0% historical coverage as indicated by the line coverage information. It represents a critical path in the program's logic that hasn't been explored yet. The current execution with input "AAAA" converts to 0.0 via atof(), which after the operations (divide by 10, add 0.1, then square) results in x = 0.01, which is not greater than 0.1. Exploring this branch would significantly improve code coverage and help understand the program's behavior when provided with numeric inputs that satisfy this condition.

EXPECTED COVERED LINES:
float5_fp_l2_klee.c:14-14

PATH CONSTRAINT:
To reach the branch `if (x > 0.1) -> true` in the logic_bomb function, we need to satisfy the following constraint:

1. The program takes a command-line string argument that is converted to a float using atof().
2. This float value undergoes the following transformations:
   - Divided by 10.0
   - 0.1 is added to the result
   - The resulting value is squared (multiplied by itself)
3. After these operations, the value must be greater than 0.1

Expressing this mathematically:
Let s = the command-line string argument
Let x = atof(s)

We need:
(((x / 10.0) + 0.1) * ((x / 10.0) + 0.1)) > 0.1

Simplifying:
((x / 10.0) + 0.1)² > 0.1
(x/10.0)² + 2*(x/10.0)*0.1 + 0.01 > 0.1
(x/10.0)² + (x/5.0)*0.1 + 0.01 > 0.1
(x/10.0)² + (x/50.0) + 0.01 > 0.1
(x/10.0)² + (x/50.0) > 0.09

Therefore, the command-line argument must be a string that represents a number such that when parsed by atof(), the resulting float value x satisfies:
(x/10.0)² + (x/50.0) > 0.09

A value of x > 2.16 would satisfy this constraint. The command-line argument should be a string representation of a number greater than 2.16, such as "3", "10", "2.17", etc.

I'll solve the path constraint to generate concrete program inputs that will satisfy the target branch condition. Let me analyze the constraint and find a valid solution.
2025-11-14 22:20:12 | INFO | Solver agent calling tool `think`
2025-11-14 22:20:12 | INFO | Thinking process: Let's analyze the target path constraint:

1. The program takes a command-line string argument that is converted to a float using atof().
2. This float value undergoes transformations and must satisfy: (x/10.0)² + (x/50.0) > 0.09

The constraint states that a value of x > 2.16 would satisfy this constraint. Let's verify this:

For x = 2.16:
(2.16/10.0)² + (2.16/50.0) = (0.216)² + 0.0432 = 0.046656 + 0.0432 = 0.089856

This is slightly less than 0.09, so x needs to be slightly larger than 2.16.

For x = 2.17:
(2.17/10.0)² + (2.17/50.0) = (0.217)² + 0.0434 = 0.047089 + 0.0434 = 0.090489

This is greater than 0.09, so x = 2.17 should satisfy the constraint.

Looking at the execution information, I see that the harness executes the binary with one string argument. Currently, it's using "AAAA" as the argument. To satisfy our constraint, we need to change this to a string representation of a number greater than 2.16.

The harness is using:
```python
result = subprocess.run(
    ["./temp_executable AAAA"],
    capture_output=True,
    encoding="utf-8",
    errors="replace",
    shell=True,
    timeout=timeout,
)
