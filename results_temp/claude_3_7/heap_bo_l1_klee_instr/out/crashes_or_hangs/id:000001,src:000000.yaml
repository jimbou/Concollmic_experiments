justification: |-
  This branch has 0% historical coverage (line cov: 0/3) and represents the "logic bomb" path in the program. The branch condition checks if the global variable `n` is not equal to 5. Currently, `n` is initialized to 5, which is why this branch is not taken in the current execution.

  The branch is particularly interesting because:
  1. It's labeled as a "logic bomb" in the code comments and prints "Logic bomb triggered" when executed
  2. It has zero historical coverage
  3. It returns a different value (1) compared to the currently executed path (0)
  4. The name of the file (heap_bo_l1_klee.c) suggests this might be a heap buffer overflow vulnerability

  This branch is likely reachable through a heap buffer overflow vulnerability. The program allocates a 16-byte buffer for `p` but uses `strcpy(p, symvar)` without bounds checking. If we provide a large input string, we might be able to overflow the buffer and potentially overwrite the global variable `n`, changing its value from 5 to something else.
target_path_constraint: |-
  To reach the target branch `if (n != 5) -> true` in the logic_bomb function, we need to exploit a heap buffer overflow vulnerability to modify the global variable `n` from its initial value of 5 to any other value.

  The constraints are:

  1. The program must be executed with at least one command-line argument (argv[1]) to avoid the `if (argc < 2)` branch in main.

  2. The command-line argument (symvar) must be carefully crafted to:
     a. Begin with any characters that will be copied into the 16-byte buffer allocated for `p`.
     b. Be long enough to overflow the 16-byte buffer allocated for `p`.
     c. Include bytes at a specific offset that will overwrite the global variable `n` with a value different from 5.

  3. The memory layout is critical for this exploit:
     - Two 16-byte buffers are allocated sequentially with `p = malloc(16)` followed by `q = malloc(16)`.
     - The `strcpy(p, symvar)` operation will copy bytes beyond the bounds of `p` if symvar is longer than 16 bytes.
     - The global variable `n` must be located at a predictable offset from the buffer `p` in memory.

  4. The input string must be precisely crafted to:
     - Have a length greater than 16 bytes to overflow the buffer.
     - Contain a non-5 value (e.g., 0, 1, 2, etc.) at the exact offset where the global variable `n` is stored in memory.

  Note: The exact offset where `n` is stored relative to the buffer `p` depends on the memory layout, heap allocator behavior, and compiler optimizations. This is a heap-based buffer overflow, which is more complex than a stack-based overflow because heap memory layout can vary between executions.
