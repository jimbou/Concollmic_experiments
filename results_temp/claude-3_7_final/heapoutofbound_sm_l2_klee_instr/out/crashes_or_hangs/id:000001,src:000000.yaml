justification: |-
  This branch has 0% historical coverage (line cov: 0/2) and represents the core functionality of the "logic bomb" that the program is designed to test. When triggered, it would execute lines 18-19 which print "Logic bomb triggered" and return a different exit code (1). 

  The branch checks if array[symvar] is either less than 0 or greater than 10. Since the array is initialized with values 0-9, we need to make symvar access an index that contains a value outside the range [0,10]. This is a classic heap out-of-bounds vulnerability test.

  This branch is more valuable to explore than the "argc < 2" branch in main because:
  1. It tests the core security vulnerability the program is designed to check
  2. It has the same coverage ratio (0/2) as the other branch
  3. Triggering this branch would reveal important program behavior related to memory safety
target_path_constraint: |-
  To reach the target branch where `if(array[symvar]<0 || array[symvar]>10)` evaluates to true in the logic_bomb function, we need the following constraints:

  1. Program execution must reach the logic_bomb function:
     - The program must be called with at least one command-line argument (argc >= 2)

  2. The value of symvar must result in accessing an array element with a value < 0 or > 10:
     - symvar = s[0] - 48, where s[0] is the first byte of the first command-line argument

  3. Since the array is initialized with values 0-9 (array[k] = k for k in [0,9]), we need:
     - Either symvar < 0, causing array[symvar] to access memory before the array (out-of-bounds negative index)
     - Or symvar >= 10, causing array[symvar] to access memory after the array (out-of-bounds positive index)

  4. For symvar < 0:
     - s[0] - 48 < 0
     - s[0] < 48
     - The first byte of the input string must be a character with ASCII value less than 48 (before '0')

  5. For symvar >= 10:
     - s[0] - 48 >= 10
     - s[0] >= 58
     - The first byte of the input string must be a character with ASCII value greater than or equal to 58 (from ':' onwards)

  6. Additionally, the out-of-bounds memory access must result in a value that is either < 0 or > 10.
     - This is not directly controllable through the input, as it depends on the memory layout and contents
     - However, accessing memory outside the bounds of the allocated array is more likely to contain values outside the range [0,10]

  Therefore, to satisfy these constraints, the input string should have its first character either:
  - With ASCII value < 48 (before '0'), or
  - With ASCII value >= 58 (from ':' onwards)

  The current input "AAAA" has 'A' (ASCII 65) as the first character, which gives symvar = 17, but the value at array[17] happens to be between 0 and 10, not triggering the branch. We need to find an input where the out-of-bounds access results in a value outside this range.
