2025-11-14 22:56:52 | INFO | Summarizer agent response: 
I need to understand how the SHA1_COMP function works to generate proper constraints. Let me think through what we know so far.
2025-11-14 22:56:52 | INFO | Summarizer agent calling tool `think`
2025-11-14 22:56:52 | INFO | Thinking process: Based on the execution trace and the code I've seen so far:

1. The program takes a command-line argument and passes it to the logic_bomb function.
2. In the logic_bomb function:
   - It extracts the first character of the input string, subtracts 48 (ASCII '0'), and stores it in symvar.
   - It then sets plaintext = symvar.
   - It initializes an array of 5 unsigned integers called cipher with specific hexadecimal values.
   - It calls SHA1_COMP(plaintext, cipher) and checks if the result is 0.
   - If the result is 0, it should trigger the "Logic bomb" path, but in our execution trace, it always takes the else branch.

3. The SHA1_COMP function is likely comparing a SHA1 hash of the plaintext with the provided cipher values. The name suggests it's related to SHA1 comparison.

4. Our goal is to find an input that makes SHA1_COMP return 0, triggering the unexplored branch.

5. From the execution information, we see that the harness is executing the program with "AAAA" as the argument. The first character 'A' has ASCII value 65, so symvar = 65 - 48 = 17.

6. We need to find a value for the first character of the input string that, when converted to an integer (by subtracting 48), produces a SHA1 hash that matches the cipher values.

Since we don't have access to the SHA1_COMP implementation, we'll need to make an educated guess based on the function name and context. It likely computes a SHA1 hash of the plaintext integer and compares it with the cipher array.

2025-11-14 22:57:06 | INFO | Target branch selected: if(SHA1_COMP(plaintext,cipher)==0) -> true in sha_cf_klee.c:logic_bomb
Justification: This branch has 0% historical coverage (line cov: 0/2) and represents the core functionality of the program - the "logic bomb" that is meant to be triggered. When this condition is true, the program executes code that prints "Logic bomb triggered" and returns 1, which has never been covered by existing test cases. This branch is clearly designed to be a key part of the program's behavior, and exploring it would significantly improve code coverage and reveal the program's intended functionality.

2025-11-14 22:57:42 | INFO | Summarizer agent calling tool `generate_path_constraint`
2025-11-14 22:57:42 | INFO | Path constraint generated: To reach the target branch where SHA1_COMP(plaintext,cipher)==0 evaluates to true in the logic_bomb function, the following constraints must be satisfied:

1. The program must be executed with at least one command-line argument to avoid the "argc < 2" branch. This means argc >= 2.

2. The first character of the input string, when converted to an integer by subtracting 48 (ASCII '0'), must produce a value that satisfies the SHA1_COMP function.

3. Specifically, we need to find a value for s[0] such that:
   - symvar = s[0] - 48
   - plaintext = symvar
   - SHA1_COMP(plaintext, cipher) == 0

4. The cipher array is initialized with specific values:
   cipher[0] = 0X902ba3cd
   cipher[1] = 0Xa1883801
   cipher[2] = 0X594b6e1b
   cipher[3] = 0X452790cc
   cipher[4] = 0X53948fda

5. Based on the function name and context, SHA1_COMP likely computes a SHA1 hash of the plaintext integer and compares it with the cipher array. The function must return 0 for the comparison to be true.

6. The constraint on s[0] can be expressed as:
   Find s[0] such that SHA1_COMP(s[0] - 48, cipher) == 0

Since the exact implementation of SHA1_COMP is not available, the specific value of s[0] that satisfies this constraint cannot be determined directly. However, the constraint system should explore different values of s[0] to find one that makes SHA1_COMP return 0 when comparing the SHA1 hash of (s[0] - 48) with the given cipher values.

EXPLORATION SUMMARY:

--- Branch 1 ---
TARGET BRANCH:
if(SHA1_COMP(plaintext,cipher)==0) -> true in sha_cf_klee.c:logic_bomb

JUSTIFICATION:
This branch has 0% historical coverage (line cov: 0/2) and represents the core functionality of the program - the "logic bomb" that is meant to be triggered. When this condition is true, the program executes code that prints "Logic bomb triggered" and returns 1, which has never been covered by existing test cases. This branch is clearly designed to be a key part of the program's behavior, and exploring it would significantly improve code coverage and reveal the program's intended functionality.

EXPECTED COVERED LINES:
sha_cf_klee.c:22-23

PATH CONSTRAINT:
To reach the target branch where SHA1_COMP(plaintext,cipher)==0 evaluates to true in the logic_bomb function, the following constraints must be satisfied:

1. The program must be executed with at least one command-line argument to avoid the "argc < 2" branch. This means argc >= 2.

2. The first character of the input string, when converted to an integer by subtracting 48 (ASCII '0'), must produce a value that satisfies the SHA1_COMP function.

3. Specifically, we need to find a value for s[0] such that:
   - symvar = s[0] - 48
   - plaintext = symvar
   - SHA1_COMP(plaintext, cipher) == 0

4. The cipher array is initialized with specific values:
   cipher[0] = 0X902ba3cd
   cipher[1] = 0Xa1883801
   cipher[2] = 0X594b6e1b
   cipher[3] = 0X452790cc
   cipher[4] = 0X53948fda

5. Based on the function name and context, SHA1_COMP likely computes a SHA1 hash of the plaintext integer and compares it with the cipher array. The function must return 0 for the comparison to be true.

6. The constraint on s[0] can be expressed as:
   Find s[0] such that SHA1_COMP(s[0] - 48, cipher) == 0

Since the exact implementation of SHA1_COMP is not available, the specific value of s[0] that satisfies this constraint cannot be determined directly. However, the constraint system should explore different values of s[0] to find one that makes SHA1_COMP return 0 when comparing the SHA1 hash of (s[0] - 48) with the given cipher values.

2025-11-14 22:57:59 | INFO | Thinking process: Let me understand the problem:

1. We need to reach a branch where `SHA1_COMP(plaintext,cipher)==0` evaluates to true.
2. The program takes a command-line argument, and we need to provide a suitable value.
3. The first character of the input string is converted to an integer by subtracting 48 (ASCII '0').
4. This integer becomes the plaintext for SHA1_COMP.
5. The cipher array has specific values: [0x902ba3cd, 0xa1883801, 0x594b6e1b, 0x452790cc, 0x53948fda]

The SHA1_COMP function likely computes a SHA1 hash of the plaintext and compares it to the cipher. 

I need to:
1. Understand what SHA1_COMP does (likely SHA1 hash comparison)
2. Find a value for s[0] such that when converted to an integer (s[0] - 48), its SHA1 hash matches the provided cipher values

Since SHA1 is a one-way function, I'll need to try different values and check if they produce the expected hash. Let's try to reverse-engineer what plaintext value would produce a SHA1 hash matching the given cipher values.

The cipher values [0x902ba3cd, 0xa1883801, 0x594b6e1b, 0x452790cc, 0x53948fda] likely represent a SHA1 hash, which is 20 bytes (160 bits) typically represented as 5 32-bit words.

Let me try to compute SHA1 hashes for different integer values and check if any match the given cipher values.

Great! I found a match. When the plaintext is the integer 7, its SHA1 hash matches the specified cipher values. Now, let's verify this is correct by checking the SHA1 hash of 7 in a different way:

Now I need to determine what character to use in the input string. According to the constraints, the first character of the input string (s[0]) is converted to an integer by subtracting 48 (ASCII '0'). So if we want plaintext = 7, then s[0] - 48 = 7, which means s[0] = 7 + 48 = 55, which is ASCII '7'.

Let's verify this with a quick check:
