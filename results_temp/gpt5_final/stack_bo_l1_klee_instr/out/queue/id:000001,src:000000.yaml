justification: 'This branch is completely untested (0% coverage for lines 14-15) and
  represents the core alternative behavior of the program: taking the overflow-triggered
  path. Exercising it will validate the program’s handling of a stack buffer overflow
  on the user-supplied argument and significantly improve behavioral coverage beyond
  the current "Path without the bomb" flow. It is reachable by crafting the single
  string argument so that copying it into the 8-byte buffer overflows and flips the
  adjacent integer control variable to 1.'
target_path_constraint: |-
  Chronological, self-contained constraints to reach the branch where the program prints the bomb path (flag == 1):

  1. Program invocation format:
     - The harness invokes a single executable with exactly one string argument. Do not change the number of arguments; provide exactly one positional argument string.
     - The argument must be delivered as argv[1] to the program’s main function.

  2. Argument encoding and transmission:
     - The argument is a byte string interpreted as C char* with no explicit length bound beyond process limits. It is copied using strcpy, which stops at the first NUL byte (0x00).
     - Therefore, the argument must not contain any NUL byte before the bytes intended to overflow the stack; otherwise, copying will stop early.
     - Encoding: ASCII or any single-byte encoding is acceptable as long as bytes are transmitted unchanged; avoid multi-byte sequences that embed 0x00.

  3. Stack layout and overflow requirement:
     - Inside logic_bomb, there is an 8-byte buffer located on the stack: buf[8]. Immediately adjacent (at a higher address in typical x86/x86_64 System V ABI with common compiler settings) is a 4-byte integer variable named flag, initialized to 0.
     - The function uses strcpy(buf, argv1). strcpy does not check bounds and will copy until it encounters a NUL terminator.
     - To reach the target branch, the copied bytes must exceed 8 bytes, so that the copy continues past buf and overwrites the next stack slot containing the integer flag.

  4. Precise overwrite constraints on the argument bytes:
     - Let A[0..k] be the bytes of the argument, terminated by a single trailing NUL (implicit from process argument storage).
     - Required length: k >= 9, i.e., at least 9 non-NUL bytes before the first NUL, to ensure copying writes beyond buf[8]. Prefer at least 12 non-NUL bytes to fully cover the size of flag (commonly 4 bytes), but the key constraint is that the byte at the offset corresponding to the first byte of flag must be written.
     - Memory layout assumption (common on GCC/Clang with no stack reordering): buf occupies 8 bytes at offsets 0..7 relative to the destination pointer; flag follows at offsets 8..11. To set flag == 1, the 4 bytes written to offsets 8..11 must encode the integer value 1 in the platform’s native endianness.
       - On little-endian platforms (typical): write bytes 0x01 0x00 0x00 0x00 at argument positions 8..11 (counting from 0 at the first byte copied into buf), followed by a NUL terminator after position 11.
       - On big-endian platforms: write bytes 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x01 at positions 8..11, followed by a NUL.
     - The first eight bytes (positions 0..7) can be any non-NUL values; they simply fill buf.

  5. Termination constraint:
     - Ensure the argument includes a NUL terminator immediately after the bytes used to set flag, so strcpy stops after overwriting exactly those bytes. In practice, command-line arguments are NUL-terminated by the OS; thus, ensure there are no embedded NULs before the desired stopping point.

  6. Environmental constraints:
     - No files are read; only argv[1] matters.
     - Do not set environment variables that alter stack protection (e.g., disabling stack canaries) unless necessary; the target assumes the binary is compiled without defenses that abort execution on overflow. If stack canaries or FORTIFY are present, the overflow might trigger a crash before reaching the branch; therefore, compile/run context should have standard unsafe strcpy semantics without immediate termination.

  Satisfying these constraints will cause strcpy to overflow buf and overwrite the integer flag with the value 1, making the condition (flag == 1) true and executing the previously untested branch body.
