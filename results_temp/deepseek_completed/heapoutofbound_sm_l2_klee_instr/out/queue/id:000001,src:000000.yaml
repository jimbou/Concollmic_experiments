target_branch: if(array[symvar]<0 || array[symvar]>10) -> true in heapoutofbound_sm_l2_klee.c:logic_bomb()

justification: This branch has 0% historical coverage and represents the core 'bomb'
  logic of the program. When triggered, it would execute the bomb path which is the
  main security vulnerability this program is designed to test. This branch is more
  complex than the simple argc check in main() and would provide more valuable coverage
  by testing the heap out-of-bounds access detection mechanism.
target_path_constraint: |-
  1. Command-Line Arguments: The program must be executed with exactly one command-line argument (in addition to the program name). This ensures argc >= 2 and the argument is available.

  2. Argument Format: The first character of the command-line argument must be a digit character ('0' through '9') to avoid undefined behavior when converting to integer. Specifically, s[0] must be in the ASCII range 48-57 ('0'-'9').

  3. Array Access Constraint: The value stored at the array index calculated from the first character must be either less than 0 OR greater than 10. Since the array is initialized with values 0-9 at indices 0-9, and indices beyond 9 contain uninitialized memory, this condition can be satisfied in two ways:
     a) For indices 0-9: The condition will never be true since array[k] = k for k=0-9, so all values are between 0-10 inclusive
     b) For indices >=10: The uninitialized memory value must be either <0 OR >10

  4. Critical Constraint: The index used to access the array (symvar = s[0] - 48) must be >= 10 to access uninitialized memory where the value could satisfy the condition. This means s[0] must be >= ':' (ASCII 58) to make symvar >= 10.

  5. Boundary Constraint: The index must be within the allocated heap bounds to avoid immediate crashes (though the program may still crash due to accessing uninitialized memory). The array is allocated with size 10, so indices 0-9 are valid, but indices >=10 are out-of-bounds.
