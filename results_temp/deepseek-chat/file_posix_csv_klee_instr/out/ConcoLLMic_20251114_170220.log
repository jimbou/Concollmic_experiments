2025-11-14 17:02:32 | INFO | Thinking process: Looking at the execution trace:

1. Program structure:
   - Main function takes command-line arguments
   - Calls logic_bomb() with argv[1] as parameter
   - logic_bomb() tries to open a file with the given path
   - If file opens successfully (fd != -1), some code is executed (currently unexecuted)
   - If trigger becomes true, some bomb code executes (currently unexecuted)
   - Otherwise, prints "Path without the bomb" and returns 0

2. Current execution path:
   - argc >= 2 (since the argc < 2 branch wasn't executed)
   - File open failed (fd == -1) since the fd != -1 branch wasn't executed
   - trigger remained 0, so the else branch was taken

3. Coverage analysis:
   - Lines 12-13: 0/2 (0%) - Code executed when file opens successfully
   - Lines 17-18: 0/2 (0%) - Code executed when trigger becomes true
   - Lines 28-29: 0/2 (0%) - Code executed when argc < 2

All unexecuted branches have 0% coverage, so they are all high priority targets. I need to understand what happens in these unexecuted branches to make an informed selection.

Now I can see the complete code. Let me analyze the branches and select the most promising target branch.
2025-11-14 17:03:00 | INFO | Summarizer agent calling tool `think`
2025-11-14 17:03:00 | INFO | Thinking process: Now I can see the complete logic:

1. Branch at line 11: if(fd != -1) - This sets trigger = 1 and closes the file
2. Branch at line 16: if(trigger) - This prints "Logic bomb triggered" and returns 1
3. Branch at line 27: if (argc < 2) - This prints usage and returns 2

All three branches have 0% coverage. The most interesting one is the logic bomb branch at line 16, which requires:
- argc >= 2 (to avoid the usage error)
- The file specified by argv[1] must exist and be readable (fd != -1)

This would trigger the bomb logic. The current test harness passes "AAAA" as the argument, but I need to understand what file path format this program expects. The comment "// {\"s\":{\"length\": 16}}" suggests the input string should be 16 characters long.

I should select the logic bomb branch as the primary target since it represents the core functionality of the program.

2025-11-14 17:03:08 | INFO | Target branch selected: if(trigger) -> true in file_posix_csv_klee.c:logic_bomb
Justification: This branch has 0% historical coverage and represents the core 'logic bomb' functionality of the program. When triggered, it would execute the bomb logic that prints 'Logic bomb triggered' and returns 1. This is the most interesting behavior to explore as it requires successfully opening a file with the given path, which would test the file I/O capabilities and the main program logic.

2025-11-14 17:03:48 | DEBUG | Target branch selection and path constraint summary completed. Result: 

EXPLORATION SUMMARY:

--- Branch 1 ---
TARGET BRANCH:
if(trigger) -> true in file_posix_csv_klee.c:logic_bomb

JUSTIFICATION:
This branch has 0% historical coverage and represents the core 'logic bomb' functionality of the program. When triggered, it would execute the bomb logic that prints 'Logic bomb triggered' and returns 1. This is the most interesting behavior to explore as it requires successfully opening a file with the given path, which would test the file I/O capabilities and the main program logic.

EXPECTED COVERED LINES:
file_posix_csv_klee.c:17-18

PATH CONSTRAINT:
1. Command-Line Arguments: The program must be executed with exactly one argument (argc == 2). The first argument (argv[0]) is the program name, and the second argument (argv[1]) must be provided.

2. Input String Format: The argument provided must be a valid file path string. Based on the code comment "// {\"s\":{\"length\": 16}}", the input string should be exactly 16 characters long.

3. File Existence and Accessibility: The file path specified by argv[1] must refer to an existing file that can be opened for reading. The open() system call with O_RDONLY flag must succeed (return a file descriptor != -1).

4. File Content: The file content doesn't matter for triggering the bomb - only the successful opening of the file is required to set trigger = 1.

Chronological execution order:
- Program invoked with: ./temp_executable "<16-character-file-path>"
- File at <16-character-file-path> must exist and be readable
- File open operation succeeds, setting trigger = 1
- Program executes the bomb logic branch
